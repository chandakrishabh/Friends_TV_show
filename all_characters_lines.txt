Q:  c'mon, you're going out with the guy! there's gotta be something wrong with him! 
A:  all right joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece? 
Q:  okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex. 
A:  sounds like a date to me.  
Q:  oh, yeah. had that dream. 
A:  then i look down, and i realize there's a phone... there. 
Q:  instead of...? 
A:  that's right. 
Q:  no. 
A:  all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. 
Q:  and they weren't looking at you before?! 
A:  finally, i figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!  
Q:  i just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... 
A:  cookie? 
Q:  no!! okay?! why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know? 
A:  sometimes i wish i was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud? 
Q:  i don't want to be single, okay? i just... i just- I just wanna be married again!  
A:  and i just want a million dollars!  
Q:  now i'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. 
A:   Tuna or egg salad?  Decide! 
Q:   if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off. 
A:   ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. 
Q:  what, like there's a rule or something?  
A:  please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound. 
Q:  yes! 
A:  ooh, this is a dear diary moment. 
Q:  hey! paul! hi! the wine guy! hey! 
A:  i'm sorry, i didn't catch your name. paul, was it? 
Q:  right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. 
A:   yes, and we're very excited about it. 
Q:  i'm thinking we've got a bookcase here. 
A:  it's a beautiful thing. 
Q:   what's this? 
A:  i would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket. 
Q:  which goes where? 
A:  i have no idea.  
Q:  done with the bookcase! 
A:  all finished! 
Q:  hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here. 
A:  yes, please don't spoil all this fun. 
Q:  you guys. 
A:  oh, god. 
Q:  you got screwed. 
A:  oh my god! 
Q:  shut up! 
A:  you must stop!  
Q:  that only took me an hour. 
A:  look, ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point! 
Q:  i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny. 
A:  stay out of my freezer!  
Q:  great story!  but, i uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,  
A:  angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats. 
Q:  isn't this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life. 
A:  that is amazing. 
Q:  y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do. 
A:  if can invade poland, there isn't anything I can't do. 
Q:  hello, paul. 
A:  hi, paul, is it?  
Q:  okayyy!  
A:  all right, kids, i gotta get to work. if i don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... 
Q:  look, it was a job all right? 
A:  'look, gippetto, i'm a real live boy.' 
Q:  i will not take this abuse.  
A:  you're right, i'm sorry.  "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..." 
Q:  are you kidding? i'm trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today. 
A:  and yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 
Q:  you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off! 
A:  oh, how well you know me... 
Q:  cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.. 
A:   Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.  
Q:   would anybody like more coffee? 
A:  did you make it, or are you just serving it? 
Q:  yeah. yeah, i'll have a cup of coffee. 
A:  kids, new dream... i'm in las vegas.  
Q:  ugh.  excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there?  Go ahead.  Thank you.  Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas. 
A:  okay, so, i'm in las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli- End 
Q:  absolutely. 
A:  yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Q:  yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
A:  the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Q:  monica and rachel's, chandler, joey, phoebe, and monica are watching three's Company.] 
A:  oh, i think this is the episode of three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Q:  whose little ball of paper is this?! 
A:  oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.  
Q:  look , i'm sorry, guys, i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
A:  yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Q:  that's because as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
A:   ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Q:  what? 
A:  ugly naked guy got a thighmaster! 
Q:  doy! probably right before she lost it! 
A:  you don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Q:  i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with... 
A:  ...dinah? 
Q:  oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
A:  now, monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Q:   i just... can't do it. 
A:  boys? we're going in.  
Q:  yeah. do that for another two hours, you might be where i am right about now.  
A:  kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon? 
Q:  what does she mean by 'involved'? 
A:  i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Q:  yeah. we don't speak. she's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
A:  what does she do? 
Q:  chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this. 
A:  well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Q:  what are we supposed to be seeing here? 
A:  i dunno, but.. i think it's about to attack the enterprise. 
Q:  since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'It is you'. 
A:  or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
Q:  yeah. cushions the blow. 
A:  yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
Q:  chandler and joey's, chandler is helping joey rehearse for a part.] 
A:  "so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 
Q:  "warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
A:  hey, that was really good! 
Q:  thanks! let's keep going. 
A:  okay. "so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?" 
Q:  "i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke." 
A:  "smoke away."  
Q:  what? 
A:  relax your hand!  
Q:  whoah! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  alright, now try taking a puff.  
Q:  no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette. 
A:  it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here.  
Q:  y'miss it? 
A:  nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke.  oh.. my.. God.   
Q:  - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
A:  oh, satan's minions at work again... 
Q:  what is this?! 
A:  i'm smoking. i'm smoking, i'm smoking. 
Q:  oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years! 
A:  and this- is my reward! 
Q:  hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
A:  okay, so this time i won't quit! 
Q:  ohhh! put it out! 
A:  all right! i'm putting it out, i'm putting it out.  
Q:  no. not after what happened with steve. 
A:  what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry. 
Q:  really! 
A:  oh, yeah. i'd marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  
Q:  i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
A:  yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 
Q:  yeah, it's his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
A:  i personally could have a gallon of alan. 
Q:  i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
A:  well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? like, collect all five? 
Q:  it's worse than the thumb! 
A:  hey, this is so unfair! 
Q:  oh, why is it unfair? 
A:  so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?  
Q:  don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
A:  hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
Q:   chandler? it's alan, he wants to speak to you. 
A:  really? he does?  hey, buddy, what's up! oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!  
Q:  monica and rachel's, everyond except monica and joey is watching lambchop.] 
A:  ooh, lambchop. how old is that sock? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. 
Q:   hey. where's joey? 
A:  joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong? 
Q:   there y'go. 
A:   ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now. 
Q:  i'm sorry.. 
A:   oh, she's sorry! i feel better! 
Q:  you had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.  
A:  ...that's it. i'm getting cigarettes. 
Q:  no no no! 
A:   i don't care, i don't care! game's over! i'm weak! i've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! 
Q:   if you never smoke again i'll give you seven thousand dollars! 
A:   yeah, alright. End 
Q:  yeah, see.. you took mine. chandler, what about you? 
A:  uh, if i were omnipotent for a day, i'd.. make myself omnipotent forever. 
Q:  ...ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. see, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. 
A:  you got waaaay too much free time. 
Q:  hockey tickets, rangers-penguins, tonight at the garden, and we're taking you. 
A:  happy birthday, pal! 
Q:  so, i'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? 
A:  well, aren't we mr. "the glass is half empty." 
Q:  what's wrong with the twentieth? 
A:  eleven days before halloween.. all the good costumes are gone? 
Q:  the hell with hockey, let's all do that! 
A:   c'mon, ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,  Huh? Huh? Huh? 
Q:  what are you doing? 
A:   i have no idea. 
Q:  alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? 
A:  you got it.  
Q:  god, isn't this exciting? i earned this. i wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totallynot worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that. 
A:   oh, this is not that bad. 
Q:  a street, chandler and joey are kicking a can to each other.] 
A:  ...poulet passes it up to leetch!  
Q:  leetch spots messier in the crease- there's the pass!  
A:  we'll take a brief time out while messier stops to look at some women's shoes. 
Q:  peach pit. 
A:  yes, bunny? 
Q:  actually, nectarines, but basically... 
A:   could've been a peach. 
Q:   sorry, sorry... uh-oh. 
A:  what? there was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? 
Q:  get him! get him! get him! get- yesss! not laughing now, are ya pal! 
A:   see buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. 
Q:  pass it! pass it! 
A:  he's open! 
Q:  shoot! shoot! shoot!  
A:  hey, look, we're on that tv thing!  Commercial Break 
Q:  an emergency room, chandler and joey are leading Ross in.] 
A:  'scuse me. 
Q:   It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied. 
A:  listen, it's kind of an emergency. well, i guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.  
Q:  the emergency room, joey is miming hockey pucks kitting foreheads.  Chandler realises it's getting tense and goes to the receptionist again.] 
A:  excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?  Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.  Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-! 
Q:  i remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow. 
A:  yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? 
Q:  look, it's just a little more complicated... 
A:  well, what? what? what is it? that she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? 
Q:  little louder, okay, i think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... 
A:  then what? 
Q:  with carol?  oh. 
A:  so in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh. 
Q:  man. can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? 
A:  i think it's great. y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic... 
Q:  really? 
A:  no, you kidding? the guy's a freak..  
Q:   oh, that's attractive. 
A:  oh, i thought you were great in silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. 
Q:  i found it. finders keepers, losers weepers.  
A:  you gotta do it, man. 
Q:  could've played monopoly, but nooooo.  
A:  thanks.  
Q:  okay, pheebs right hand blue. Good.   
A:  hello? oh, uh, rachel, it's the visa card people. 
Q:  oh, okay. will you take my place? 
A:  alright.  yes, this is rachel. 
Q:   i've got magic beans.  Never-never mind. 
A:  to the left, to the left- aww!  
Q:  come on! you guys can pee standing up. 
A:  we can? all right, i'm tryin' that. 
Q:  central perk, all are there.] 
A:  so, saturday night, the big night, date night, saturday night, Sat-ur-day night! 
Q:  no plans, huh? 
A:  not a one. 
Q:  not even, say, breaking up with janice? 
A:  oh, right, right, shut up. 
Q:  chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. you just gotta do it. 
A:  no, i know, but it's just so hard, you know? i mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note. 
Q:  you know, if you want, i'll do it with you. 
A:  oh, thanks, but i think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. 
Q:  yeah, well, it's a mercedes if i move back home. oh, it was horrible. he called me young lady. 
A:  ooh, i hate when my father calls me that. 
Q:   ok, bye.  well, monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel. 
A:  oh. well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? 
Q:  it's laundry. the thinking through is minimal. 
A:  it's just you and rachel, just the two of you? this is a date. you're going on a date. 
Q:  nuh-uh. 
A:  yuh-huh. 
Q:  so what're you saying here? i should shave again, pick up some wine, what? 
A:  well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. this is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty? 
Q:   no. 
A:  oh, and uh, the fabric softener? 
Q:  ok, ok, now what is wrong with my snuggles? what, it says i'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way. 
A:  there you go. 
Q:  central perk, chandler and phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their significant others.] 
A:  where are they? where are they? 
Q:  this is nice. we never do anything just the two of us. 
A:  it's great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies. 
Q:  eww, i don't wanna do that.  
A:  here we go. 
Q:  ok, have a good break-up. 
A:  hey, janice. 
Q:  oh, my god, i am so glad you called me. i had the most supremely awful day. 
A:  hey, that's not good. can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please? 
Q:  we got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...  
A:  what? 
Q:  what? 
A:   what... did you get me there? 
Q:  i got you...these.  
A:  bullwinkle socks. that's so sweet. 
Q:  well, i knew you had the rockys, and so i figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want. 
A:  that's great.  
Q:   no, no, i'm still working on mine.  
A:  that's it? 
Q:  yeah, it was really hard. 
A:  oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal. 
Q:  ok, you can do this. it's just like pulling off a band-aid. just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.  
A:  janice. hi, janice. ok, here we go. i don't think we should go out anymore. Janice. 
Q:  central perk, chandler is still trying to ease things over with janice, and there are about a dozen empty Espresso cups in front of him. He is extremely wired.] 
A:  here's the thing, janice. you know, i mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom. 
Q:  ow! 
A:  oh, my god, i'm so sorry. are you ok? 
Q:  ow. um, it's just my lens. it's just my lens. i'll be right back.  
A:   i hit her in the eye! i hit her in the eye! this is the worst break-up in the history of the world. 
Q:  oh my god.  how many of those have you had? 
A:  oh, i don't know, a million? 
Q:  chandler, easy, easy. go to your happy place. la la la la la la la. 
A:  i'm fine. 
Q:  all right.  
A:  i'm not fine. here she comes. 
Q:  wait here. breathe.  
A:  how do you do that? 
Q:  it's like a gift. 
A:  we should always always break up together. 
Q:  oh, he needed some time to grieve.  
A:  i'm free! i'm free! 
Q:  did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do? 
A:   ross, ten o'clock. 
Q:  is it? feels like two. 
A:  no, ten o'clock. 
Q:  what? 
A:   there's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! 
Q:  oh. hel-lo! 
A:  she's amazing! she makes the women that i dream about look like short, fat, bald men! 
Q:  well, go over to her! she's not with anyone. 
A:  oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.' 
Q:  oh, c'mon. she's a person, you can do it! 
A:  oh please, could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up here. 
Q:  he could never get a woman like that in a million years. 
A:  thank you, buddy. 
Q:  you could do that! 
A:  y'think? 
Q:  yeah! 
A:  oh god, i can't believe i'm even considering this... i'm very very aware of my tongue... 
Q:  c'mon! c'mon! 
A:  here goes.  
Q:  ...yes? 
A:  hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... chandler! chandler is my name, and, uh......hi. 
Q:  yes, you said that. 
A:  yes, yes i did, but what i didn't say was what i was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.  
Q:   saw your head. saw your head. 
A:   she said yes!! she said yes!!  awful play, man. Whoah.  Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way.  Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.  
Q:  central perk, everyone else is there as chandler enters.] 
A:  hey, kids. 
Q:   no, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line. 
A:  well, i can't believe i've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went. 
Q:  oh, right, right. how was your date, 'chand-lrr'? 
A:  it was unbelievable. i-i've never met anyone like her. she's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...  
Q:  ...luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. so, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories. 
A:  alright. once i got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and i rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it. 
Q:  ...all of a sudden we realised we were in yammon. 
A:  oh, i'm sorry, so 'we' is? 
Q:  who's rick? 
A:  who's rick? 
Q:  ooooohhh. 
A:  oh, so you're divorced? 
Q:  no. 
A:  oh, i'm sorry, then you're widowed?...hopefully? 
Q:  no, i'm still married. 
A:  so tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket? 
Q:  don't worry. i imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan. 
A:  ethan? there's, there's an ethan? 
Q:  what?! 
A:  so explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend? 
Q:  i suppose mainly sexual. 
A:  ...hm. 
Q:  oh. i'm sorry it didn't work out. 
A:  what 'not work out'? i'm seeing her again on thursday. didn't you listen to the story? 
Q:  didn't you listen to the story? i mean, this is twisted! how could you get involved with a woman like this? 
A:  well, y'know, i had some trouble with it at first too, but the way i 
Q:  tah-daaah! 
A:  are we greeting each other this way now? 'cause i like that. 
Q:   i can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman. 
A:  thank god you didn't try to fan out the magazines. i mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out. 
Q:  why would someone do that?! ...one might wonder. 
A:  someone's left a glass on the coffee table. there's no coaster. it's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood... 
Q:  c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that's big! 
A:  oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness. 
Q:  thank you!   
A:  where's joey? his mom's on the phone. 
Q:  he's in the bathroom. i don't think you wanna go in there! 
A:  c'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!! 
Q:  who is being loud? 
A:  oh, that would be monica. hey, listen, i wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast. 
Q:  oh, you got the whole night, huh? 
A:  yeah, well, i only have twenty minutes until ethan, so, y'know..  
Q:  ooh, do i sense a little bit of resentment? 
A:  no, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'kay? y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?  
Q:  chandler and joey's, aurora and chandler are in bed in chandler's room.] 
A:  god, i love these fingers... 
Q:  thank you. 
A:  no, actually i meant my fingers. look at 'em, look at how happy they are. 
Q:   oh my god, i'm late.

Q:  okay. 
A:  don't go. 
Q:  okay. oh no, i have to. 
A:   too bad, she's leaving. 
Q:   i'm sorry. he'll be waiting for me. 
A:  well, i thought- i thought you talked to rick. 
Q:  it's not rick. 
A:  what, ethan? he got to spend the whole day with you! 
Q:  no, it's-it's andrew. 
A:  i know there'll be many moments in the years to come when i'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is? 
Q:  he's... new. 
A:  oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by rick, Ethan and myself? 
Q:  no, that's not exactly what i was.. 
A:  well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us. 
Q:  so what do you want? 
A:  you. 
Q:  you have me! 
A:  nono, just you. 
Q:  whaddyou mean? 
A:  lose the other guys. 
Q:  ...like, ...all of them? 
A:  c'mon, we're great together, why not? 
Q:  why can't we just have what we have now? why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too. 
A:  ...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like i'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!' 
Q:  so... which one of the two guys will you listen to? 
A:  i don't know, i-i have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish... 
Q:  which one? 
A:  ...the second guy. 
Q:   well, call me if you change your mind.  
A:  sorry, the first guy runs the lips.  
Q:  no? what happened, big guy? 
A:   "big guy?" 
Q:  my mom will. 
A:  something so sweet and...disturbing about that. 
Q:  the atm vestibule of a bank, chandler is inside. the lights go out, and he realizes he is trapped inside.] 
A:  oh, great. this is just...  Opening Credits 
Q:  atm vestibule, jill goodacre is on the cellular phone. chandler's thoughts are in italics.] 
A:  oh my god, it's that victoria's secret model. something... something Goodacre. 
Q:   hi mom, it's jill. 
A:  she's right, it's jill. jill goodacre. oh my god. i am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot! 
Q:   yeah, i'm fine. i'm just stuck at the bank, in an atm vestibule. 
A:  jill says vestibule... i'm going with vestibule. 
Q:   i'm fine. no, i'm not alone... i don't know, some guy. 
A:  oh! some guy. some guy. 'hey jill, i saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.  
Q:  atm vestibule.] 
A:  alright, alright, alright. it's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!

Q:   oh my god! he's trapped in an atm vestibule with jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen.  
A:  yeah, like that thought never entered my mind. 
Q:  would you like some gum? 
A:  um, is it sugarless? 
Q:   sorry, it's not. 
A:  oh, then no thanks. what the hell was that? mental note if jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it. 
Q:  atm vestibule.] 
A:  you know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself. 
Q:  atm vestibule.] 
A:   ah, let's see. what next? blow a bubble. a bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.  
Q:  nice going, imp. ok, it's ok. all i need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.  
A:  good save! we're back on track, and i'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.  
Q:  my god, you're choking!  That better? 
A:   yes... thank you. that was... that was....

A:  hi, um, i'm account number 7143457. and, uh, i don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape. End 
Q:  hey gorgeous, how's it going? 
A:  dehydrated japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this? 
Q:  question. you're not dating anybody, are you, because i met somebody who would be perfect for you. 
A:  ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'... 
Q:  do you want a date saturday? 
A:  yes please. 
Q:  okay. he's cute, he's funny, he's- 
A:  he's a he? 
Q:  monica and rachel's, everyone is there.) 
A:  ...couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. i mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that? 
Q:  um... yeah. well, i mean, when i first met you, y'know, i thought maybe, possibly, you might be... 
A:  you did? 
Q:  yeah, but then you spent phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not. 
A:  huh. did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me? 
Q:  nono, me neither. although, uh, y'know, back in college, susan sallidor did. 
A:  you're kidding! did you tell her i wasn't? 
Q:  no. no, it's just 'cause, uh, i kinda wanted to go out with her too, so i told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...  
A:  well, this is fascinating. so, uh, what is it about me? 
Q:  i dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny... 
A:  ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him? 
Q:  yeah! right! 
A:  what is it?! 
Q:  yes. absolutely. a quality. 
A:  oh, oh, a quality, good, because i was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.  
Q:  central perk, chandler, phoebe, joey, and rachel are there.] 
A:  i just have to know, okay. is it my hair? 
Q:  chandler's office, shelley is drinking coffee; chandler enters.] 
A:  hey, gorgeous. 
Q:   hey. look, i'm sorry about yesterday, i, um- 
A:  no, nono, don't- don't worry about it. believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake. 
Q:  oh! okay! phew! 
A:  so, uh... what do you think it is about me? 
Q:  i dunno, uh... you just have a-a... 
A:  ...quality, right, great. 
Q:  y'know, it's a shame, because you and lowell would've made a great couple. 
A:  lowell? financial services' lowell, that's who you saw me with? 
Q:  what? he's cute! 
A:  well, yeah... 's'no brian in payroll. 
Q:  is brian...? 
A:  no! uh, i d'know! the point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him. 
Q:  well, i think brian's a little out of your league. 
A:  excuse me? you don't think i could get a brian? because i could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not. 
Q:   morning. we ready to go? 
A:  well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...it's stuff like that, isn't it?  
Q:  what? 
A:  nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like brent mussberger. 
Q:  check it out, giants-cowboys.  
A:  you're watching a football game at a funeral? 
Q:  no, it's the pre-game. i'm gonna watch it at the reception. 
A:  you are a frightening, frightening man.  
Q:  here, sweetie, here. i took these when i had my golfing accident.   
A:  oh, no- 
Q:  sorry- hi, i'm dorothy's daughter. 
A:  hi, i'm chandler, and i have no idea who dorothy is.  
Q:  ...chandler! 
A:  hey. 
Q:  yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. can we be grown-ups now? 
A:  who are those people? 
Q:  chandler's office, chandler is on a coffee break as lowell enters.] 
A:  hey, lowell. 
Q:  hey, chandler. 
A:  so how's it going there in financial services? 
Q:  it's like mardi gras without the paper mache heads. how 'bout you? 
A:  good, good. listen, heh, i dunno what shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not. 
Q:  i know. that's what i told her. 
A:  really. 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  so- you can tell? 
Q:  pretty much, most of the time. we have a kind of... radar. 
A:  so you don't think i have a, a quality? 
Q:  speaking for my people, i'd have to say no. by the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is. 
A:  he is? 
Q:  yup, and waaay out of your league.  
A:  out of my league. i could get a brian.  if i wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian. End 
Q:  hey, hey. 
A:  hey. 
Q:  hey. 
A:  and this from the cry-for-help department. are you wearing makeup? 
Q:  yes, i am. as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor slash model. 
A:  that's so funny, 'cause i was thinking you look more like joey Tribbiani, man slash woman. 
Q:  you know, the asthma guy was really cute. 
A:  do you know which one you're gonna be? 
Q:  no, but i hear lyme disease is open, so...  
A:  good luck, man. i hope you get it. 
Q:  and i assume, chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays. 
A:  yes, every single one of them. 
Q:  absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop. only a hundred and two dollars to go. 
A:  i thought it was $98.50. 
Q:  oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say. 
A:  i'd just like to say that i'm totally behind this experiment. in fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.  
Q:  wait, wait, chandler, this is what you're havin' for thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? 
A:  all right, i'm nine years old. 
Q:  oh, i hate this story. 
A:  we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. 
Q:  oh my god. 
A:  yes. it's very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. 
Q:  set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd. 
A:  tonight, on a very special blossom. Commercial Break 
Q:  i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop. 
A:  oh, you must stop shooping. 
Q:  chandler, will you just come in already? 
A:  no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.  
Q:  look out, incoming pumpkin pie! 
A:  ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.  
Q:  ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!  
A:  the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away. 
Q:  the balloon? 
A:  no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me? 
Q:  i can't, i gotta go. 
A:  come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen? 
Q:  no, no, no, you said, "got the keys". 
A:  do either of you have the keys? 
Q:  why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? 
A:   for an emergency just like this. 
Q:  why? because everything is my responsibility? isn't it enough that i'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I... 
A:  ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.  
Q:  stop it, stop it, stop it! 
A:  now this feels like thanksgiving.  
Q:  it's nice that he has someone.  
A:  shall i carve? 
Q:  by all means. 
A:  ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? 
Q:  the bigger half. 
A:  i'd like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. 
Q:  and a crappy new year. 
A:  here, here! Closing Credits 
Q:  that is so cruel! why? why would a parent name their child bethel? 
A:  hey, that monkey's got a ross on its ass! 
Q:  so you guys, i'm doing all new material tonight. i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman. 
A:  might wanna open with the snowman.  
Q:  hey, do you guys know what you're doing for new year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's? 
A:  nothing for you, you have paolo. you don't have to face the horrible 
Q:  yeah, you wish! 
A:  it's just that i'm sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner. 
Q:  yeah, okay. alright. 
A:  y'know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 
Q:  well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear! 
A:   that guy's going home with a note! 
Q:  well, he's kinda like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... 
A:  wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact. 
Q:  no, no, no, no, no, no. yeah, could i just? 
A:  yeah, 'cause i already asked janice. 
Q:  c'mon, this was a pact! this was your pact! 
A:  i snapped, okay? i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped. 
Q:  yeah, but janice? that-that was like the worst breakup in history! 
A:  i'm not saying it was a good idea, i'm saying i snapped!  
Q:  hi. hi, sorry i'm late.  
A:  too many jokes... must mock joey! 
Q:  nice shoes, huh?  
A:  aah, y'killing me!  
Q:  i didn't wanna leave him alone. alright? we- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... 
A:  y'know, if you're gonna work late, i could look in on him for you. 
Q:  oh, that'd be great! okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. 
A:  okay, but if he asks, i'm not going to lie. 
Q:  i'm sorry, okay. it's just that chandler has somebody, and phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby. 
A:  fun bobby? your ex-boyfriend fun bobby? 
Q:  you know more than one fun bobby? 
A:  i happen to know a fun bob. 
Q:  oh, it's-it's marcel. he keeps shutting me out, y'know? he's walking around all the time dragging his hands... 
A:  that's so weird, i had such a blast with him the other night. 
Q:  really. 
A:  yeah, we played, we watched tv.. that juggling thing is amazing. 
Q:  what, uh... what juggling thing? 
A:  with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that. 
Q:  no. 
A:  y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. he just balled up socks... and a melon...  
Q:  i love this artichoke thing! oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!  
A:  you remember janice. 
Q:   there you are! haaah, you got away from me! 
A:   but you found me! 
Q:  here, ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera! 
A:  kill me. kill me now.  
Q:   oh, i'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter. 
A:  alright, janice, that's it! janice... janice... hey, janice, when i invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we- 
Q:  oh, no. oh, no. 
A:  i'm sorry you misunderstood... 
Q:  oh my god. you listen to me, chandler, you listen to me. one of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.   
A:  oh, will you give me the thing.   
Q:  there y'go, kids. 
A:   and then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight.  
Q:  you seen sandy? 
A:  ooh. uh, i don't know how to tell you this, but she's in monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you. 
Q:   in twenty seconds it'll be midnight... 
A:  and the moment of joy is upon us. 
Q:  not everybody's happy. hey bobby!  
A:  y'know, i uh.. just thought i'd throw this out here. i'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.  
Q:  perfect. perfect. so now everybody's getting kissed but me. 
A:  alright, somebody kiss me. somebody kiss me, it's midnight! somebody kiss me! 
Q:  monica and rachel's, monica and phoebe are telling everyone about their coma guy.] 
A:  are there no conscious men in the city for you two? 
Q:  the always interesting nora tyler bing. you might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.  
A:  y'know, we don't have to watch this. weekend at bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax. 
Q:  c'mon, she's your mom! 
A:  exactly. weekend at bernie's! dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No? 
Q:  chandler, i gotta tell you, i love your mom's books! i love her books! i cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool! 
A:  yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.' 
Q:  c'mon, chandler, i love your mom. i think she's a blast. 
A:  you can say that because she's not your mom. 
Q:  your mom was arrested? 
A:  shhh, busy beaming with pride. 
Q:   ...this is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after i've been intimate with a man... 
A:  now why would she say that's embarrassing? 
Q:   ...i just get this craving for kung pow chicken. 
A:  that's too much information!! 
Q:  awww! 
A:  this is the way that i find out. most moms use the phone. 
Q:   oh no, i am a fabulous mom! i bought my son his first condoms.  
A:  ...and then he burst into flames. 
Q:  i am famished. what do i want...  
A:  please god don't let it be kung pow chicken. 
Q:  oh, you watched the show! what'd you think? 
A:  well, i think you need to come out of your shell just a little. 
Q:  oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila. 
A:  i know i am. 
Q:  oh, please, honey, listen, if i can do it, anybody can. you just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book. 
A:  myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.  
Q:  you don't kiss your friend's mom! sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!  
A:  what are you guys doing out here? 
Q:  yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size. 
A:  okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.  
Q:  chandler and joey's, ross is talking to chandler. joey is making a snack at the bar.] 
A:  oh my god. 
Q:  you're my friend. i-i had to tell you. 
A:  i can't believe it. paolo kissed my mom? 
Q:  yeah, um, i don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom. 
A:  what? 
Q:  i was really upset about rachel and paolo, and i think i had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in- 
A:   you knew about this? 
Q:  uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing. 
A:  i spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?! 
Q:  thanks, man, big help. 
A:   i can't believe this! what the hell were you thinking? 
Q:  i wasn't- i mean, i- 
A:  y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap i go through with my mom more than you. 
Q:  i know- 
A:  i can't believe you did this.  
Q:  me neither, y'know what- 
A:  i'm still mad at you for not telling me. 
Q:  chandler- 
A:  you gotta let me slam the door!  
Q:   okay, that was phoebe buffay, everybody. woo!  
A:  what was that? 
Q:  oh, uh, phoebe just started a... 
A:  yeah, i believe i was talking to joey, alright there, mother-kisser?  
Q:  chandler, can i just say something? i-i know you're still mad at me, i just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips. 
A:  yes, well, i expect this from her. okay? she's always been a freudian nightmare. 
Q:  okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something? 
A:  because it's complicated, it's complex- hey, you kissed my mom!  
Q:   we're rehearsing a greek play. 
A:  that's very funny. we done now? 
Q:  no! okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel? 
A:  that would be no. look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.

A:  ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!  
Q:  need a new table. 
A:  you think? 
Q:  chandler and joey's,  joey and chandler use their knees as a table to support the lasagna.] 
A:  ok, so it's just because it was my table, i have to buy a new one? 
Q:  that's the rule. 
A:  what rule? there's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! 
Q:  how'd you get to that? 
A:  well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio 
Q:  you knew about that? 
A:  well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. 
Q:  ok, ok, how about if we split it? 
A:  what do you mean, like, buy it together? 
Q:  yeah 
A:  you think we're ready for something like that? 
Q:  why not? 
A:  well, it's a pretty big commitment, i mean, what if one of us wants to move out? 
Q:  why, are you moving out? 
A:  i'm not moving out. 
Q:  you'd tell me if you were moving out right 
A:  yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate kip... 
Q:  aw, i know all about kip! 
A:  it's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly. 
Q:  well, let me ask you something, was kip a better roommate than me? 
A:  aw, don't do that 
Q:  hey, chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. 
A:  fine.

Q:  thanks rach.  
A:  so what are you gonna do? 
Q:  you have to tell her! you have to tell her! it's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?  
A:  oh, yeah, you have to tell her. 
Q:  will you pick one, just pick one! here, how about that one?  
A:  that's patio furniture! 
Q:  so what, like people are gonna come in and think, "uh-oh, i'm outside again?" Of course! 
A:   what about the birds? 
Q:  i don't know, birds just don't say, "hello, sit here, eat something." 
A:  you pick one. 
Q:  all right, how about the ladybugs? 
A:  oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining! 
Q:  fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! 
A:  not like that, i won't!  kip would have liked the birds!  
Q:  chandler and joey's, ross, chandler, joey, and monica admiring their new table.] 
A:  so, what do you think? 
Q:  i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen. 
A:  i know!  
Q:  come on, two on one. 
A:  what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! 
Q:  yes, now is when you swoop! you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo! 
A:  my catholic friend is right. she's distraught. you're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!  
Q:  i'm having a boy! oh, i'm having a boy!  
A:  wha- 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  uh, it's 230 in the morning! 
A:  yeah, get out! 
Q:  you guys are always hanging out in my apartment! come on, i'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going,  and I'm gone. 
A:   one more game? 
Q:  that is it! you just barge in here, you don't knock 
A:  i'm sorry! 
Q:  you have no respect for anybody's privacy! 
A:  rachel, wait, wait. 
Q:  no, you wait! this is ridiculous! 
A:  can i just say one thing? 
Q:  what? what?! 
A:  that's a relatively open weave and i can still see your... nipular areas. 
Q:  okaaay.  any of you guys want anything else? 
A:  oh, yes, could i have one of those.  
Q:  no, i'm sorry, we're all out of those. anybody else? 
A:  okay. 
Q:  did i, uh, did i miss something? 
A:  no, she's still upset because i saw her boobies. 
Q:  you what? wh what were you doing seeing her boobies? 
A:  it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts. 
Q:  okay, pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change. 
A:  y'know, i don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies. 
Q:  nice? they were nice. i mean, that's it? i mean, mittens are nice. 
A:  okaaay,  rock, hard place, me. 
Q:  you're so funny! he's really funny! i wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops. 
A:  whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what'd you mean by that? 
Q:  oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance. 
A:  huh. 
Q:  i mean hey! i just met you, i don't know you from adam. ...only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty. 
A:  uhhuh, how did you know that? 
Q:  i know, i mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts? 
A:   what?  what? 
Q:  alright, alright. we're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee. 
A:  y'know, i don't see that happening? 
Q:  c'mon, he's right. tit for tat. 
A:  well i'm not showing you my 'tat.'  
Q:  c'mon up. 
A:   oh, good. rog is here. 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... i hate that guy. 
Q:  night, you guys.  
A:  oh look, it's the woman we ordered. 
Q:  oh no, not you, big joey. oh my god, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip? 
A:  uh, joey's having an embolism, but i'd go for a nip, y'know? Commercial Break 
Q:  now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee. 
A:  joey, if i go first, i wanna be looking for my keys. 
Q:  thank you. uh... 
A:  so, who's up for a big game of kerplunk? 
Q:  thanks. you're, uh, you're a good kid. 
A:  c'mon, i'll show you to my room. ...that sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late." 
Q:  chandler and joey's, night. chandler and joey are sharing the sofabed in the living room. Joey is restless.] 
A:  hey, kicky. what're you doing? 
Q:  just trying to get comfortable. i can't sleep in my underwear. 
A:  well, you're gonna. 
Q:  i've been thinking. y'know, about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls... 
A:  are they end to end, or tall like pancakes? 
Q:  y'know what i mean, about how i'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking... 
A:  hey, you're not him. you're you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave? 
Q:  no. 
A:  no. you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married." 
Q:  you really think so? 
A:  yeah. i really do. 
Q:  thanks, chandler.  
A:  get off! 
Q:  i thought it was chandler! 
A:   what? what? 
Q:  you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing! 
A:  sorry, my my thing was in there with me. 
Q:  i dunno, there's just something about... 
A:  basically we just feel that he's... 
Q:  wow. 
A:  things sure have changed here on waltons mountain. 
Q:  just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them. 
A:  if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom. 
Q:  she barely knows me. we just live in the same building. 
A:  any contact? 
Q:  hey.  
A:  come on, ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third... 
Q:  yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "here's your egg back, i'm returning your egg." 
A:  i think it's winning. 
Q:  i think it's insane. 
A:  she'll love it. go with the egg, my friend.  
Q:  think it'll work? 
A:  no, it's suicide. the man's got an egg. Opening Credits 
Q:  actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. 
A:  oh, uh, listen, about tonight... 
Q:  no, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. the only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. 
A:  yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a... 
Q:  hi. she said yes. 
A:  yes! way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh? 
Q:   how do i look? 
A:  oh, uh, i... don't... care.  ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

A:  ...and what did you bring? 
Q:  she's checking the coats. joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. 
A:  janice?  
Q:  oh.... my.... god. 
A:   hey, it's janice.

A:  calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that i've dumped twice in the last five months!

A:  i'm sorry, i'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!! 
Q:  by the way, chandler. i cut you out of all my pictures. so if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. 
A:  that's ok. 
Q:   we can't do that. 
A:   what? what can't you do? 
Q:  uh, we might be leaving now. 
A:  tell me it's "you and me" we. 
Q:  she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. i'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it. 
A:  ok, you can not do this to me. 
Q:  i'm outta here. here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, Chandler. 
A:  i hope she throws up on you.  
Q:  just us. 
A:  oh, what a crappy night! 
Q:  although, i have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. 
A:  excuse me.  How ya doin'? 
Q:  so, do we have the best friends or what? 
A:  joey's not a friend. he's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV? 
Q:  i will go for that drink. 
A:  you got it. good woman!  could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne? 
Q:  each. 
A:  that's right, each. oh, and a uh rob roy.  i've always wanted to know... 
Q:  oh, i miss you already. can you believe this happened? 
A:  no... no! and yet it did. good-bye, janice.

A:  how can i dump this woman on valentine's day? 
Q:  i don't know. you dumped her on new year's. 
A:  oh, man. in my next life, i'm coming back as a toilet brush.  
Q:  hello, funny valentine. 
A:  hi, just janice. 
Q:  i brought you something. 
A:  is it loaded? oh, little candy hearts.  chan and Jan Forever. 
Q:  i had them made special. 
A:  ok, janice. janice. hey, janice. look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out. 
Q:  that's fine. 
A:   it is? 
Q:  mmm-hmm. because i know that this isn't the end. 
A:  oh no, you see, actually it is. 
Q:  no, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing. 
A:  oh, no i don't. 
Q:  well then ask yourself this. why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? 
A:  i did, but... 
Q:  you seek me out. something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.  
A:  call me! 
Q:  chandler. 
A:  mrs. tedlock. you're looking lovely today. and may i say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you. 
Q:  yes. well, mr. kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day. 
A:  oh, listen. if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing. 
Q:  hey you guys! chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...  
A:  hey! 
Q:  what is it? 
A:  so, it's a typical day at work. i'm inputting my numbers, and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. 
Q:  that's great! 
A:  so.... i quit. 
Q:  why? 
A:  why? this was supposed to be a temp job! 
Q:  yeah, chandler... you've been there for five years. 
A:  if i took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do. 
Q:  so was it a lot more money? 
A:  it doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.  
Q:  ... the wenus? 
A:  weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term. 
Q:  so what're you going to do? 
A:  i don't know. that's the thing. i don't know what i want to do. i just know I'm not going to figure it out working there. 
Q:  hi!  oh, yeah, no, i know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so.... 
A:  yeah... i just don't have that much cheffing experience. unless it's an all-toast restaurant. 
Q:  yeah, i know!  so, what do you think? 
A:  thanks, phoebe. but i just don't really see myself in a big white hat. 
Q:  monica and rachel's, chandler walks in, wearing a suit.] 
A:  can you see my nipples through this shirt? 
Q:  where are you going, mr. suity-man? 
A:  well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo." 
Q:  career counselor? 
A:  hey, you guys all know what you want to do. 
Q:  i don't! 
A:  hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream. 
Q:  so great! he showed me where the restaurant's going to be. it's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right. 
A:  was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears? 
Q:  ok, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma? 
A:  who are you going out with? 
Q:  oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey. 
A:  and he's not speaking metaphorically. 
Q:  my god! what happened to you? 
A:  eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation." 
Q:  that's so great! 'cause you already know how to do that! 
A:  can you believe it? i mean, don't i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something. 
Q:   here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up. 
A:  ooh, you know, i had a grape about five hours ago, so i'd better split this with you. 
Q:  it's supposed to be that small. it's a pre-appetizer. the french call it an amouz-bouche. 
A:   well.... it is amouz-ing...  
Q:  oh! i see. and i've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that i can waitress in the Olympics. 
A:  you know, i don't mean to brag, but i waited tables at innsbruck in '76.  Amouz-bouche?  
Q:  ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...  
A:  ....with?? 
Q:  you're not going to believe this! 
A:  it's ok. it's ok. i was always rooting for you two kids to get together. 
Q:  hey chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again. 
A:  again? 
Q:  and again, and again, and again...  hello?  And again. 
A:   hey mr. kostelic! how's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday!  
Q:  chandler's new window office, he is showing phoebe around.] 
A:  well?

Q:  thank you helen, that'll be all.  
A:  last time i do that, i promise. 
Q:  chandler's office, he's on the phone, agitated.] 
A:   yes, fran. i know what time it is, but i'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!...  Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good!  Whooooaaaa.... Closing Credits

A:  oh, no, no. nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. 
Q:  thats unbelievable. 
A:  and yet, believable. so i decided not to fire her again until i can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. 
Q:  i see. i guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head. 
A:  well, i guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.  
Q:  aw, how can you say that? i cant even get marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid? 
A:  you know, ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.  
Q:  do you have a sec? 
A:  ah, sure, nina. whats up? 
Q:  i dont know. for the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. 
A:  oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us. 
Q:  maybe. but that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors. 
A:  ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise. 
Q:  i am? 
A:  sure, why not? 
Q:  oh my god!  youre amazing! 
A:  oh, you dont know.  helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise? 
Q:  what? 
A:  helen drinks.  will you marry me?  
Q:  monica and rachels, ross, rachel, chandler, and phoebe are sharing a bowl of popcorn, while Monica carefully reads the instruction manual for her television set.] 
A:  well, i ended up telling her everything. 
Q:  oh, howd she take it? 
A:  pretty well. except for the stapler thing.  
Q:  i mean, i know joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but... 
A:  youre not gonna lose him. 
Q:  right, but, it is just me and the baby, so i'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field. 
A:  what are you crazy? that's a baby! 
Q:  anyway, suddenly i'm down field, and i realise that i'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father. 
A:  hey, you're gonna be fine. you're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad. 
Q:  oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the rainbow room? is it real expensive? 
A:  well, only if you order stuff. 
Q:  you take your time.  
A:  there it is! so what're you gonna do? 
Q:  what can i do? look, i don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula. 
A:  and your friend phoebe? 
Q:  well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. i mean, wouldn't you guys? 
A:  man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.  
Q:  what? monica, they are cute, they are doctors,  cute doctors, doctors who are cute! 
A:  alright, what have we learned so far?  
Q:  oh... 
A:   "happy birthday peehe." 
Q:   oh, oh, oh! this is so great! oh my god! this was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi!  You found Betty! Oh my god!  This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room,  Where's Joey?  
A:  did you see betty?  
Q:  monica and rachel's, chandler is neglecting the game of scrabble, for he's busily drawing on his own childhood in an attempt to help Ross. Marcel chitters about.] 
A:  okay, worst case scenario. say you never feel like a father. 
Q:  uh-huh. 
A:  say your son never feels connected to you, as one. say all of his relationships are affected by this. 
Q:  do you have a point? 
A:  you know, you think i would.  
Q:  it's just a fur ball. 
A:  okay...  ..whose turn is it? 
Q:  yours, i just got 43 points for 'kidney'. 
A:  no, no, you got zero points for 'idney'. 
Q:  what's goin' on?  
A:  marcel swallowed a scrabble tile. 
Q:  yeah. the doctor got the 'k' out. he also found an 'm' and an 'o'. 
A:  we think he was trying to spell out 'monkey.'  
Q:  well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now. 
A:   so, you feel like a dad yet? 
Q:  no, why? 
A:  hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. that is very dad.  
Q:  ¿a quién pidio el pollo general tso?  
A:  ¡pudo aver sido general tso!   
Q:  do you really want a job with popular mechanics? 
A:  well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for. 
Q:   give me that!  
A:  you know, i can't believe you. linda is so great! why won't you go out with her again? 
Q:  i don't know. 
A:  is this still about her whole 'the flintstones could've really happened' thing? 
Q:  no, it's not just that. it's justi want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...  
A:  ...little playthings with yarn? 
Q:  what?

Q:  thank you. 
A:   we were playing poker, alright... 
Q:  oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'read 'em and weep.' 
A:  and then he did. 
Q:  oh, ok, so then what is it? some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it? 
A:  there just don't happen to be any women in our games. 
Q:  monica and rachel's, the guys are teaching the girls how to play poker.] 
A:   ok, so now we draw cards. 
Q:  congratulations!  
A:  ok phoebs, how many do you want? 
Q:  whoa, whoa, whoa, monica, what're you doin'? this is a poker game. you can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz... 
A:   ok, so at this point, the dealer... 
Q:  but... i'm ready, so, just deal. 
A:  ok, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson.  Joey... three... eight. Eight... three.  Alright babe, deal the cards.  
Q:  whoa, whoa, whoa!

A:  the... jamestown colony of virginia. you see, king george is giving us the land, so... 
Q:  ...yeah. 
A:  yes, and i get my ya-yas from ikea. you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. 
Q:  alright boys, let's eat. 
A:  oh, did you get that from the 'i love rachel' pizzeria? 
Q:  you still on that? 
A:  oh, come on. what was with that whole black bart speech?  "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!" 
Q:  guys! guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what! 
A:  um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident? 
Q:  alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand. 
A:  oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, i don't know... Pictionary?  
Q:  oh, i cursed it. so now bad things will happen to he who spends it. 
A:  that's alright, i'll take it. bad things happen to me anyway. this way I can break 'em up with a movie. 
Q:  you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' Coincidence? 
A:  hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'c'! 
Q:  chandler? 
A:  couldn't be more out.  
Q:  let me see! show them! 
A:  y'know, i've had dates like this. 
Q:  i'm in for fifty cents.  
A:  call. 
Q:  that's ok, ross, you can ask me. what?  
A:   what do you need, what do you need? 
Q:  fifteen. 
A:  alright, here's ten.  
Q:  thank you. 
A:  good luck. 
Q:   ahhh, that's alright. y'know, that's a tough hand to beat. 
A:   i thought we had them! 
Q:  monica and rachel's, all six are playing pictionary at monica's apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what looks like an airplane.] 
A:  airplane! airport! airport '75! airport '77! Airport '79!  
Q:  ok, ok, it's my turn.  
A:  go.  
Q:  suck-fest. 
A:  toootal chick-flick. 
Q:  alright, i've gotta go. c'mon, marcel! c'mon! we're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are. 
A:  they're still just friends, right? 
Q:  joe-g's pizza, the guys are there.] 
A:  i can't believe we are even having this discussion. 
Q:  i agree. i'm, like, in disbelief. 
A:  i mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with rachel, they would've happened already? 
Q:  well, i think it's perfect. y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey... 
A:  i can't remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey. 
Q:  anyway, i figured after work i'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her. 
A:  hey, y'know what you should do? you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used. 
Q:  whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative? 
A:  rachel lost marcel. 
Q:  alright alright. you're a monkey. you're loose in the city. where do you go? 
A:  okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room. 
Q:  dun-dun-duuuur! sorry.  
A:  marcel? 
Q:  marcel? 
A:  marcel? 
Q:  hi, can i help you?  
A:  um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something... 
Q:  a monkey. 
A:  yes have you seen any? 
Q:  just a sec.  hope you find your monkey.  
A:  oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu. 
Q:  uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here? 
A:  yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! and they're very hot. 
Q:  we can't, alright?  we're sorry. you have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.  
A:  okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people. 
Q:  marcel? 
A:  marcel?!  
Q:  that's because i'm in front of them. 
A:  eh. i thought that was an alp. 
Q:  i dunno, i loved high school. y'know? it was just four years of parties and dating and sex. 
A:  yeah, well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys. any sex i had would've involved a major lifestyle choice. 
Q:  oh, that is so sick. 
A:  i feel violated. and not in a good way. 
Q:  central perk, everyone but rachel is there.] 
A:  i am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games... 
Q:  so have you called her yet? 
A:  let her know i like her? what are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right? 
Q:  oh, god, just do it!  call her! stop being so testosteroney! 
A:  which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat.  I got her machine. 
Q:  her answer machine? 
A:  no, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up. 
Q:  so, uh, why didn't you say anything? 
A:  oh, no-no-no-no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o." 
Q:  that man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  oh! 
A:   and basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. 
Q:  oh!... right! 
A:  hey rach! 
Q:  yeah, but it was different with him today! and he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?  
A:  yes! 
Q:  why? 
A:  i have my reasons. 
Q:  monica and rachel's, everyone is there except rachel.] 
A:   oh, danielle! i wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God! 
Q:  that's what you've been working on for the past two hours?! 
A:  hey, i've been honing! 
Q:  what was with the dishes? 
A:  oh, uh.. i want her to think i might be in a restaurant.. y'know? i might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. 
Q:  yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.  
A:  what are you looking at me for? i didn't know that. 
Q:  monica and rachel's, chandler enters clutching his phone.] 
A:  can i use your phone? 
Q:  yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.  
A:  yes, it's working! why isn't she calling me back? 
Q:  y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet. 
A:  y'don't think that makes me seem a little... 
Q:  ...desperate, needy, pathetic? 
A:  ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.  
Q:  how many beeps? 
A:  she answered. 
Q:  y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about. 
A:  i'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.  
Q:  please. if she said to you, "ross, i want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?  
A:  if it helps, i could slide over. 
Q:   i just have to go, all right? do i need a reason? huh? i mean i have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?  
A:  hello? hello?  
Q:   hello? mindy! hi! hey, how are you?  yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great.  Really?  Oh.  Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and...  Okay...  Great...  Great...  All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow!  Okay..  Okay...  Bye.  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. 
A:  so how's mindy? 
Q:  brrrrrrr!  
A:  hell is filled with people like you. 
Q:  get down? 
A:  ...and boogie! 
Q:  oh, hold up, i'll walk out with you. now, rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That's fine, yeah...  
A:  okay, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. will you watch my phone? 
Q:  why don't you just take it with you? 
A:  hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee? 
Q:  why don't you just call her? 
A:  i can't call her, i left a message! i have some pride. 
Q:  do you? 
A:  no!  danielle, hi! it's, uh, it's chandler!  i'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone.  Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.  Okay.   She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back... 
Q:  don't you have to pee? 
A:  's'why i'm dancing... 
Q:  four letters "circle or hoop". 
A:  ring dammit, ring! 
Q:   hey, you know our phone's not working? 
A:  what?! 
Q:  i tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer. 
A:   i turned it off. mother of god, i turned it off! 
Q:  hey, so listen, i went across the street and talked to the doorman- i got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone? 
A:  nngghhh!!!!!!! 
Q:   chandler? 
A:  danielle! hi! uh- everybody, this is danielle, danielle, everybody. 
Q:  hi. hi. 
A:  what are you doing here? 
Q:  well, i've been calling you, but it turns out i had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay. 
A:  ...i'm, i'm okay. 
Q:  listen uh, maybe we could get together later? 
A:  that sounds good. i'll call you- or you call me, whatever... 
Q:  you got it. 
A:  okay. 
Q:  second date! 
A:  ...i dunno. 
Q:  you don't know?! 
A:  well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?  End 
Q:  i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. 
A:  wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop. 
Q:  what? it's, it's just a phase. 
A:  well, that's what we said about joey... 
Q:  central perk, joey and chandler are discussing stage names.] 
A:  how about joey... pepponi? 
Q:  no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral. 
A:  joey... switzerland?  
Q:  plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not. 
A:  joe...joe...joe...stalin? 
Q:  stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar. 
A:  well, it does not ring a bell with me... 
Q:   joe stalin. y'know, that's pretty good. 
A:  might wanna try joseph.  
Q:  joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that! 
A:  oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. 
Q:  at the vet. 
A:  she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? 
Q:  she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. 
A:  so what does this mean? 
Q:  i can't believe it, ross. this sucks! 
A:  i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already? 
Q:  how do you get a monkey into a zoo? 
A:  i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen. 
Q:  well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. 
A:  yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo.  
Q:  hey. we found her, we found the girl. 
A:  what? 
Q:  nope. we took her to lunch. 
A:  ah. your own brand of vigilante justice. 
Q:  yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader. 
A:  ...take off their hats! 
Q:   you know there already is a joseph stalin? 
A:  you're kidding. 
Q:  apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that! 
A:  y'know, you'd think i would've. 
Q:  we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing... 
A:  ...he's in. 
Q:  oh! 
A:  okay, bye, champ. now, i know there's gonna be a lot of babes in san Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn. 
Q:  shut up! 
A:  tell me what? 
Q:  look at you, you won't even look at him. 
A:   oh, come on tell me. i could use another reason why women won't look at me. 
Q:  doing it on this table.  
A:  wow! 
Q:  why, why, why would you dream that? 
A:  more importantly, was i any good? 
Q:  well, you were pretty damn good. 
A:  interesting, cause in my dreams, i'm allways surprisingly inadequate.  
Q:  i love it, when we share.  
A:  you're okay there? 
Q:  i can't belive you two had sex in her dream. 
A:  i'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious. Opening Credits 
Q:  central perk, continued from earlier, chandler is sitting on the table.] 
A:  hello rachel.

Q:  no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am. i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO. 
A:  a cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid. 
Q:  he's... our age. 
A:  when we were? 
Q:  college? 
A:  whoa! and this manchild has no problem with how old you are?

A:  see, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me. 
Q:  no, i didn't tell anybody that i knew you.

A:  what?! 
Q:  i thought you knew that. 
A:  noho. who doesn't they like me? 
Q:  everyone. except for uh... no everyone. 
A:  what are you talking about? 
Q:  don't feel bad. you know they used to like you a lot. but then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".  
A:  i can't belive it. 
Q:  yeah, yeah. they even do you. 
A:  they do me? 
Q:  you know like... uh okay... uh... 'could that report be any later?'  
A:  i don't sound like that. 
Q:  'my scones.'  
A:  okay, i don't sound like that. that is so not true.  
Q:   okay, andré should be there in like 45 minutes. all rightie, bye bye.  Just easier that way. 
A:  oh, come on. you told me about the last dream. 
Q:  no, forget it. 
A:  oh, why not. was i doing anything particularly... saucy? 
Q:  no. you know, sometimes just things doesn't work out. 
A:  and this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.  
Q:  stegosaurus! 
A:  tyrannosaurus!  
Q:  um, oh, i've got a birthday party, with some work people. 
A:  work people? nobody told me. 
Q:  no, i know. that's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza. 
A:  you know, i don't get this. a month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person. 
Q:  well, then you should come tonight. you know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are. 
A:  you think i should? 
Q:  i really do, yeah.

A:  i think last night was great. you know, the karaoke thing. tracy and i doing Ebony and Ivory. 
Q:  you were great. but they still made fun of you. 
A:  what? 
Q:  you know, now you're more like, you know like, "mr. caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!" 
A:  then, i don't get it.

A:   ooooh.  
Q:  well, thank you, melanie. 
A:   ok, this one right here is from me. 
Q:  there is a little child inside this man! 
A:  yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.  
Q:  who's this from? 
A:  oh, that's ross's. 
Q:  it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered! 
A:  well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?  
Q:  i can't believe he did this. 
A:  come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?  
Q:  what did you just say? 
A:   ahem... um... crystal duck. 
Q:  no, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part? 
A:   f-hah.... flennin.... 
Q:  oh.... my god. 
A:   oh, no-no-no-no-no.... 
Q:  i know. this is really, really huge. 
A:  no it's not. it's small. it's tiny. it's petite. it's wee. 
Q:  nuh-uh. i don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again. 
A:  ok, is there a mute button on this woman? 
Q:  ross? all this time? well, i've got to talk to him.  
A:   h-he's in china! 
Q:  no, no, wait.  his flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes. 
A:  what about the time difference? 
Q:  from here to the airport? 
A:  yes!  you're never gonna make it! 
Q:  i-i-i don't know. 
A:  well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
Q:  noooo... look, all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.  
A:  rachel, i love you! deal with me first!  
Q:  chandler and joey's, chandler is eating breakfast, joey quietly opens his bedroom door.] 
A:  hey, big... 
Q:  shhhh! 
A:   ...spender. 
Q:  she's still asleep. 
A:  so how'd it go? 
Q:  oh, it was amazing. you know how you always think you're great in bed? 
A:  the fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. 
Q:  well, it's like, last night, i couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! 
A:  yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. 
Q:  it was amazing! and not just for her... uh-uh. for me, too. it's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level. 
A:  i didn't know you had another level. 
Q:  seven hundred bucks! 
A:  alright, you did it! do we have any fruit? 
Q:  man, hell of a two weeks, huh? y'know what, though? i really feel like i learned something. 
A:  really? so, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing? 
Q:  monica and rachel's, the gang is waiting for rachel to return from the airport with Ross.] 
A:   no way! 
Q:  guys, you got your hair cut. 
A:  yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay. 
Q:   airport, airport. ross, not alone, julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp. 
A:  ok, i think she's trying to tell us something. quick, get the verbs.  
Q:  yeah, it's really 600 tomorrow night our time. 
A:  well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause i like to be surprised.  
Q:  thank you. 
A:  hey, rach, can i get... 
Q:  did you talk to him? 
A:  not yet. 
Q:  then, no.  
A:  so what the hell happened to you in china? i mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. 
Q:  i know, i know i was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was? 
A:  god? 
Q:  it was you, pal. 
A:  well, maybe it was god, doing me. 
Q:  look, you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. but then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you. 
A:  well, you owe me one, big guy. 
Q:  go-go-go-go, come on!   so uh, what did you find out? 
A:  he said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. i'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever. 
Q:  how is that the silver lining? 
A:  you have to really wanna see it. 
Q:   hello? hi. 
A:   hi. anybody know a good tailor? 
Q:  needs some clothes altered? 
A:  no, no, i'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk. 
Q:  why don't you go see frankie? my family's been goin' to him forever. he did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990? 
A:  okay.  you have to stop the q-tip when there's resistance! 
Q:  i know you did. i'm just gonna deal with it, i'm just gonna deal with it.  I gotta get out of here.  
A:  ok, i don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her. 
Q:  well, i sorta did a stupid thing last night. 
A:  what stupid thing did you do? 
Q:  honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. 
A:  people do stupid things when they're upset. 
Q:   ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass. 
A:  well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, i've got pants that need to be altered. 
Q:  hey, chandler, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means. 
A:  are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code? 
Q:  how long do you want the cuffs? 
A:  at least as long as i have the pants.  
Q:  look, rach, rach! i've been with my share of women. in fact, i've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you. 
A:   yo, paisan! can i talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man! 
Q:   hey, what's goin' on?  
A:  joey's tailor...took advantage of me. 
Q:  no way. i've been going to the guy for 12 years. 
A:  oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... 
Q:  what? 
A:  cupping. 
Q:  thank you. my hair is very amused. 
A:  come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. 
Q:  hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... 
A:  that's ok.  
Q:  i guess so.  
A:  you know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.  
Q:   what are you guys doing? 
A:  we're just hanging out by the spoons. ladle? 
Q:  carol? 
A:  carol? i was just wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding? 
Q:  chandler? 
A:  so, uh, how often can you do it? 
Q:   hi, honey. 
A:  hey, sweetums. 
Q:  it's gonna be a problem, isn't it? 
A:  come on, you're going to bloomingdale's with julie? that's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. 
Q:  duh, i think i know how to heat breast milk. ok.  
A:  what did you just do? 
Q:  what is the big deal?  
A:  what did you just do? 
Q:  no, no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it. i just, i just don't think breast milk is for adults. 
A:  of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. 
Q:  chandler and joey's, chandler is wiping down the peninsula counter as joey enters dressed like a cowboy.] 
A:  howdy. 
Q:   gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre. 
A:  well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. 
Q:  or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. 
A:   what do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you. 
Q:  i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. 
A:   all right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run? 
Q:  yeah i guess you're right. 
A:  you're damn right i'm right. i say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. 
Q:  i'm gonna do it.  
A:  all right. now go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. 
Q:  i broke up with her. 
A:  they were huge. when she sneezed, bats flew out of them. 
Q:  come on, they were not that huge. 
A:  i'm tellin' you, she leaned back, i could see her brain. 
Q:  hold it hold it. i gotta side with chandler on this one. when i first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts. 
A:  you or me? 
Q:  you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason. 
A:  maureen rosilla. 
Q:  all right, bye-bye. 
A:  ok, janice. janice. you gotta give me janice. that wasn't about being picky. 
Q:  ok, it's very faint, but i can still sense him in the building. go into the light, Mr. Heckles! 
A:  ok, phoebe. 
Q:  well, it's not so much that you know, like i don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.  
A:  uh-oh. it's isaac newton, and he's pissed. 
Q:  have you ever seen so much crap? 
A:  actually, i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap 
Q:  huh. so now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why? 
A:  hey, look at this. "my big book of grievances." 
Q:  hey, there's me! april 17th. excessive noise. italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too. 
A:  april 18th, excessive noise. italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent. 
Q:  check it out, check it out. heckles' high school yearbook. 
A:  wow, he looks so normal. 
Q:  "heckles, you crack me up in science class. you're the funniest kid in school. 
A:  funniest? heckles? 
Q:  that's what it says. 
A:  wow, heckles was voted class clown, and so was i. he was right. would you listen to that? 
Q:  i'd call that excessive. 
A:  whoa! 
Q:  what? 
A:  heckles played clarinet in band, and i played clarinet. and he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool. 
Q:  so, you were both dorks. big deal. 
A:  i just think it's weird, you know? heckles and me, heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off? 
Q:  have you been here all night? 
A:  look at this. pictures of all the women that heckles went out with. look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did. 
Q:  chandler, heckles was a nut case. 
A:  our trains are on the same track, ok? yeah, sure, i'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction. 
Q:  all right, you know what we gotta do? we gotta get you outta here. come on, i'll buy you breakfast, let's go. 
A:  what if i never find someone? or worse, what if i've found her, but i dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"? 
Q:  chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody. 
A:  how do you know that? how? 
Q:  i don't know, i'm just tryin' to help you out. 
A:  you'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and i'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays? 
Q:  well, i don't know. i don't know what we're gonna be doin'. i mean, what if we're at her folks' place? 
A:  yeah, i understand. 
Q:  you can come over and watch the super bowl. every year, all right? 
A:  you know what? i'm not gonna end up like this. i'll see you man. 
Q:  supposably. supposably. did they go to the zoo? supposably. 
A:   hi, it's me. 
Q:  janice? you called janice? 
A:  yes, janice. why is that so difficult for you to comprehend? 
Q:  you remember janice, right? 
A:  yes. she was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. janice is my last chance to have somebody. 
Q:  helloo!! 
A:  oh, my, god! 
Q:  hey, it's everybody. 
A:  janice, you're-- 
Q:  yes, i am. 
A:  is it--? 
Q:  is it yours? ha! you wish, chandler bing. you are looking at a married lady now. 
A:  congratulations. 
Q:  oh, sweetie, i'm sorry. 
A:  you couldn't have told me about this on the phone? 
Q:  hey chandler. monica just broke my seashell lamp. 
A:  neat. i'm gonna die alone. 
Q:  chandler, you're not gonna die alone. 
A:  janice was my safety net, ok? and now i have to get a snake. 
Q:  uh huh. why is that? 
A:  if i'm gonna be an old, lonely man, i'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout! 
Q:  you have got to get over this. you're not gonna end up alone. 
A:  of course i am. i reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there. 
Q:  wait a minute, wait a minute. yes he is. you are totally different. 
A:  in a bad way? 
Q:  you are ready to make a commitment! 
A:  whoa! don't know about that. 
Q:  that's fine. 
A:  hey. well, you will all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing. 
Q:  hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you? 
A:  i'll take that. 
Q:  you want his yearbook? 
A:  yeah, yeah. some people said some nice things about him. i think somebody should have it.

Q:  you comin'? 
A:  yeah, jus' second. good-bye mr. heckles. we'll try to keep it down.

Q:  wait a minute, who told you?  you are dead meat. 
A:  i didn't know it was a big secret. 
Q:  you have a third nipple? 
A:  you bitch.

A:  joey was in a porno movie. 
Q:  huuh. 
A:  if i'm goin' down, i'm takin' everybody with me. 
Q:  so, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? 
A:  why yes ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia. 
Q:  you know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you. 
A:  huh? are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? 
Q:  the ice capades? 
A:  no, no the gravel capades. yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when snoopy falls. . . funny. 
Q:   oh, darnit, we're all out of milk.  Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here? 
A:  oh i see, i see, because of the third nipple thing. ha ha ha ha. . . 
Q:  julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.   
A:  uh, julie. 
Q:  yeah? 
A:  sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. but, uh, it's gone now, you're alright. 
Q:  ross's apartment. after dinner. chandler enters.] 
A:  what's this in my pocket? why it's joey's porno movie. 
Q:  so is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind. 
A:  ok, now wait a minute. that is the craziest typing test i've ever seen. 
Q:  shh, ok, here i come, here i come. see i'm comin' to fix the copier, i can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad fo r the paper tray. 
A:  nice work my friend. 
Q:  that saves us a conversation. 
A:  well, listen, this has been great but i'm officially wiped. 
Q:  so. i mean, who here does not have the time to get to know julie? 
A:  i got the time to get to know julie. 
Q:  now, what exactly is in a cobb salad? 
A:  i'm goin' home. 
Q:  man, i sure miss julie. 
A:  spanish midgets. spanish midgets wrestling. julie. ok, yes, i see how you got there.  
Q:  you ever figure out what that thing's for? 
A:  no, see, i'm trying this new screening thing. you know, i figure if i'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. 
Q:  hello, i'm looking for bob. this is jane. i don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? 
A:  what? 
Q:  i got a little drunk...and naked. 
A:  bob here. 
Q:  oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. 
A:  can you hold on a moment? i have another call.  i love her. 
Q:  i know. 
A:  i'm back. 
Q:  so, are we gonna get together or what? 
A:  um, absolutely. uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? do you know uh, central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish? 
Q:  great, i'll see you then. 
A:  ok. ok. having a phone has finally paid off. 
Q:  even though you do do a good bob impression, i'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob." 
A:  i'm hoping that when bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. 
Q:  oh my god. you are pure evil. 
A:  ok, pure evil, horny and alone. i've done this.  
Q:   hi, julie. 
A:  ok, while ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.

Q:  no, i'm on right after this guy shoots himself. 
A:  whoa, she's pretty. 
Q:  it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. 
A:  oh, ok. 
Q:  i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.

A:  believe me, sometimes that happens. 
Q:  well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? 
A:  you know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true. 
Q:  that's him. 
A:  damn. my mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.

A:   ok, ok, you can be shirts and i'll be skins. I'll be skins.  Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor. 
Q:  this is it, isn't it? i mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this? 
A:  well, i relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed. 
Q:  ya know, i just, so weird. i mean i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July. 
A:  becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other? 
Q:  it's just this thing. every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just... 
A:  i, i know.  
Q:  i'm getting ready for the water skiing.  How are you doing? 
A:  well, uh, dr. greene, where are you going? 
Q: alright, alright, i can get my own coat.  
A:  sorry, we're on a major flan high.

A:  no. 
Q:  give it to me. 
A:  ok, you can have it.  
Q:   There you go, enjoy your coffee. 
A:  that was there when i got here.  
Q:  had it. 
A:  had it. 
Q:  chandler's office. joey is there.] 
A:  hey, look joey, i'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, i can get you a job right here as an entry level processor. 
Q:  but don't you need experience for a job like that? 
A:  it's not that hard to learn. and as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor. 
Q:   hey chandler, here's this morning's projections. 
A:  hey thanks. scott alexander, joey tribbianni. joey is a uh, fellow processor. 
Q:  uhh, well, right now i'm in between things. you know how it is. one day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more. 
A:  i was just telling joey about the opening in fleischman's group. 
Q:  hey. 
A:  hey, how's the first day goin'? 
Q:  pretty good. it's like you said. it's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column. 
A:  well there you go. 
Q:  hey and everbody is so nice. i just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie. 
A:  jeannie, the head of east coast operations jeannie? 
Q:  yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. small world huh? 
A:  weird world. your kids? 
Q:  i figure my character has kids. 
A:  ya know there isn't a part of that sentence i don't need explained. 
Q:  well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does. 
A:  well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes. 
Q:  yeah. joseph and his wife, karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did. 
A:  really? wow. that's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there. 
Q:  what a phony. 
A:  well, i'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas. 
Q:  uh, listen bing, i received your memo. so, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday? 
A:  well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families. 
Q:  yeah bing, what's that about? 
A:  it's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday. 
Q:  have the final numbers on my desk by tuesday. 
A:  uh, if you say so sir. 
Q:  joseph's good, isn't he? 
A:  well, i'm going to kill you. 
Q:  hey, hey, i just figure joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers. 
A:  why? 
Q:  hey. mr. douglas is looking for you. 
A:  why? wh- wh- why is mr. douglas looking for me? 
Q:  'cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the lender project. 
A:  wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that? 
Q:  becasue at first he thought it was joseph. but after he asked joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know. 
A:  alright, that's it. look joey, i'm sorry, i realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go. 
Q:  what're you talking about, everybody loves joseph. 
A:  i don't, i hate joseph, ok. i think he's a brown-nosing suck up. 
Q:  oh yeah. well you can't fire joseph. you know why, 'cause he's not in your department. 
A:  alright, ok, alright. so i can't fire joseph but uh, i can sleep with his wife. 
Q:  karen. 
A:  yeah, karen. i'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did. 
Q:  ahh. what the hell are you doing to me man. 
A:  oh well it's not me, it's my character, chandy. yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer. 
Q:  really? 
A:  no freakshow, she's fictional. 
Q:  take it easy. if it means that much to you, i'll uh, i'll go find something else. 
A:  thank you. 
Q:  yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. see, i, uh, had to kiss this guy. 
A:  'cause he was just so darn cute. 
Q:  continued from earlier] 
A:  hey, what did your agent say? 
Q:  over my dead body!  
A:  and i'll be using his dead body as a shield. 
Q:  ooh-oh! someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. someone get a little action? 
A:  i may have.

A:  well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.

A:  i like this girl, okay, i seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes i tend get a little defended and quipy... 
Q:  please! 
A:  well she totally called me on it, okay. she said, 'cut it out, get real', and i did. 
Q:  wow! what's that like? 
A:  it's like this, me, no jokes. 
Q:  could not be more terrified. 
A:  well, i think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum. 
Q:  come on, chandler, i want this part soo much.  just one kiss, I won't tell anyone. 
A:  joey, no means no!  
Q:  hey! 
A:  i'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep. 
Q:  so how's your date with your cyberchick going. ooh, hey, what is all that . 
A:  oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the guggenheim  museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words. 
Q:  what does she mean by hh? 
A:   it means we're holding hands. 
Q:  are you the cutest? 
A:  i'm afraid i might just be. 
Q:  you know, what i think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy. 
A:  okay, it's not a guy, all right, i know her. 
Q:  oh, well. just ask her how long she's gonna live. women live longer than men. 
A:  how do you not fall down more? 
Q:  okay, ask her 'what is her current method of birth control?' 
A:  all right.  "my husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married! 
Q:  well at least we know she's a woman. 
A:  i can't believe she's married. 
Q:  aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. she wants to know what's wrong? 
A:  what's wrong? what's wrong? you're married that's what's wrong.  
Q:  oh, my. 
A:  what? 
Q:  she wants to meet you in person. 
A:  hey, look, phoebe i wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband. 
Q:  what if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. i mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip. 
A:  okay, i'll do it! 
Q:  central perk, chandler, rachel, ross, joey, and phoebe are there waiting for Chandler's cyberchick to arrive] 
A:  where is she, where is she?  oh, hey, i have a question, where is she? 
Q:  chandler, relax, chandler, she'll be here. 
A:   ooh, oh, oh, that's her. 
Q:  chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. it's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...  
A:  oh my god!  
Q:  chandler and joey's, joey is coming in from the bedroom]

Q:  oh, i wish. look, honey, you have that report to finish, and i gotta go see my lawyer. 
A:  i can not believe that i am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up. 
Q:   i-i-i gotta go, i gotta go. okay, not without a kiss.

A:  well, i'm crazy about her now. i think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters. 
Q:  look, what do you want me to say? 
A:  i want you to say that you like her! 
Q:  i can't. it's like this chemical thing, you know. every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her. 
A:  thanks for trying.  oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore! 
Q:  women tell each other everything. did you know that? 
A:  umm, yeah. 
Q:  no chandler, everything! like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth.... 
A:  girth? why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? 
Q:  rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna? 
A:  we're not gonna talk about girth are we? 
Q:  nooo! 
A:  yeah, okay. 
Q:  yeah? 
A:  yeah! all right! you go first. 
Q:  okay, okay, i'll go first. 
A:  okay.

A:  princess leia in the gold bikini. 
Q:  yes! 
A:  i know! 
Q:  yes! wow, well, that-that was easy. okay, you-you go.

A:  okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman. 
Q:  hmph. 
A:  and, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. and you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place.... 
Q:  with the belly-button ring? oh, muhawa! 
A:  i know, and then all of the sudden your mom pops into your head. and your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know! 
Q:  your mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your mom, what is the matter with you? 
A:  you said... 
Q:  hey!

A:  you still can't stand her can you? 
Q:  i'm sorry man, i tired, i really did. 
A:  well, you know, i appreciate you giving it a shot. 
Q:  but, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium. 
A:  well, i guess that's something. 
Q:  no man, that's huge! now, i know i can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway. 
A:  okay. 
Q:  oh, hey, chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross. 
A:  oh god! 
Q:  hey, if it makes you feel any better, i do it too. 
A:  really? 
Q:   yep, it's fat. i drank fat! 
A:  yeah, i know, i did that two minutes ago. 
Q:   hey! 
A:  hey, mister tux! 
Q:  ohh, well, you're my lucky penny. 
A:   all right, i took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men.  Get up. 
Q:  what? 
A:  you're in my seat. 
Q:  how is this your seat? 
A:  'cause i was sitting there. 
Q:  but then you left. 
A:  well, it's not like i went to spain. i went to the bathroom, you knew i was coming back. 
Q:  what's the big deal, sit somewhere else. 
A:  the big deal is i was sitting there last, so, that's my seat. 
Q:  you guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So.. 
A:  all right, ross, i just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal.  GET UP!! 
Q:  uh, no. wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind. 
A:  well, joey, i wrote a little song today. it's called get up. 
Q:  all right! you can have the chair. 
A:  really! 
Q:  what if it's new? i mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back? 
A:  honey, you did call him back. 'cause, it's, it's really old. 
Q:  i.....got.....dressed. really, really quickly. okay, okay.  There we go, there we go. 
A:  you know what, okay, fine. don't get up, you just sit right there. i just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here.  Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!  
Q:  okay, thanks. yeah, i'll try that. 
A:  maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy. 
Q:  noo!  no! 
A:  all right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair.  I'm soooo, comfortable. 
Q:  me too. in fact, i think i might be a little too comfortable. 
A:  all right!  
Q:  okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. okay, chandler, i want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay. 
A:  all right! fine! i'm going. but when i get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!  
Q:  well, who's voice was that? 
A:  maybe it was his sister's. you know, maybe it was his daughter's. 
Q:  yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. all right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you. 
A:  all right, you will notice that i am fully dressed. i, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!" 
Q:  okay.  
A:  what are you doing? 
Q:  you said i had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions. 
A:  the cushions are the essence of the chair! 
Q:  that's right! i'm taking the essence. 
A:  oh-ho, it'll be back. oh-ho, there's nobody in the room. 
Q:  no honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. i love you. i love you. 
A:  we used them as pillows when we went camping. 
Q:  what? 
A:   the sheep. 
Q:  whoa, whoa, whoa. come on, come on, what. you took his underwear? 
A:  he took my essence! 
Q:  it's a rented tux. okay. i'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues. 
A:  well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions. 
Q:  okay, you hide my clothes. i'm gonna do the exact opposite to you. 
A:  what are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes? 
Q:  hey, opposite, is opposite!  
A:  he's got nothing! 
Q:  rachel, didn't have anything that i liked, so, but she had this christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.' 
A:  what are you supporting? 
Q:  it was, it was her voice. 
A:  monica, i think you've gone over to the bad place. 
Q:   uh, michelle. yeah, that was me, i-i dialed your number by mistake.  Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that.... 
A:   you know what's weird. donald duck never wore pants. but whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about? 
Q:  okay, fine.  
A:  they got a phone in there, right? 
Q:   get away from that! no!  She's just getting dressed. 
A:  is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that?  
Q:  okay, buddy-boy. here it is. you hide my clothes, i'm wearing everything you own. 
A:  oh my god! that is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!! 
Q:  look at me! i'm chandler! could i be wearing any more clothes? maybe if I wasn't going commando... 
A:  oooo-ooh! 
Q:  okay, okay. enough, enough with the lunging. no! i'm sick of this. okay. i've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party! 
A:  jeez, what a baby. 
Q:   how 'bout instead you, go get changed!  you, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!  
A:  stop it. stop it!  
Q:   well, i have to tell you, i was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written. 
A:  excuse me. hi. 
Q:  yes? 
A:  well, your kind of sitting in my seat. 
Q:  what do you mean, your seat? 
A:  i mean, i was sitting there. 
Q:  but, you got up! 
A:  but, i never left the room! 
Q:  but, you left the chair area. 
A:  all right, that's it, give me your underwear. End 
Q:  hey. 
A:  hey. 
Q:  nooo. i had a story all worked out but then chandler sold me out. 
A:  well, i'm sorry joe. i didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket. 
Q:  whoa, jam! i love jam!  hey, how come we never have jam at our place? 
A:  because the kids need new shoes. 
Q:  hey. 
A:  do i look fat? 
Q:  noo. 
A:  okay, i accept that. when janice asked me and i said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow. 
Q:  okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it. 
A:  okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her.... 
Q:  and it works both ways. 
A:  okay, so you both just know this stuff? 
Q:  okay, for instance. let's say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do? 
A:  that's easy, baggage claim. 
Q:   wrong! now you're single. it's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her. 
A:  okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something. 
Q:  good luck chandler. 
A:  thank you rachel. 
Q:   okay the sleeping thing. very tricky business, but there is something you can do. 
A:  well, i thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers. 
Q:  noo! no, not cuddlily, not me, just her. i'm like you, i need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed... 
A:  yeah.  
Q:  i'm gonna use the cushion. 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  okay, you're in bed. she's over on your side, cuddling. now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you. 
A:  okay, the old hug and roll. 
Q:  yep. 
A:  okay, one question. 
Q:  shoot. 
A:  you're pretending the pillow's a girl right? 
Q:  okay, first i'm not crazy. and second, say it don't spray it. anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order. 
A:  umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom. 
Q:  aww.  ohh! 
A:  hey, joe, i gotta ask. the girl from the xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.  
Q:  i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies. 
A:  well, your gonna need much bigger jars. 
Q:  it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid. 
A:  that, that's what's stupid. 
Q:  night-night bing-a-ling. 
A:  night-night.....janice.  'look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom!  Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'  Commercial Break 
Q:  monica and rachel's, joey is eating jam straight out of the jar, and chandler is staring at him in amazement. Joey offers him some.] 
A:  no, that's all right. i just had a jar of mustard. 
Q:   okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis. 
A:  you mean there's more than one of us.

Q:  hey. 
A:  hey, man. what's up? 
Q:  maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?! 
A:  well, i'll tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me. 
Q:   'annie! hi. listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.' 
A:  is anybody else scared? 
Q:   'right, well look, um, if joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?'  I need a pen.

Q:  what's the big deal? why don't you wanna see janice? 
A:  okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes. 
Q:  and that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata? 
A:  noo. 
Q:  you didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you. 
A:  no, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. and this alarm 
Q:  what is it with you people! i mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away? 
A:  i know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid. 
Q:  hey, you know about that?! 
A:  look what do i do? i wanna get past this, i don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!  
Q:   where there is no fear of commitment. 
A:  do we have any... do we have any thoughts here? 
Q:  amazingly, that makes sense. 
A:  you think? 
Q:  oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind! 
A:  yeah, joe, i assure you if i'm staring down the barrel of a gun, i'm pretty much peeing every which way. 
Q:  so, how come you wanted to eat in tonight? 
A:  'cause, i wanted to uh, give you this.  
Q:  ohhh, are you a puppy!  contact paper! i never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper. 
A:  well, wait there's, there's more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser. 
Q:  oh, you didn't have to do this. 
A:  yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get. 
Q:  well, i gotta buy a vowel. because, oh my gawd! who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer. 
A:  well, not me. but that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip. 
Q:  we should? 
A:  yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. and, i wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents! 
Q:   i don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay? 
A:  i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay. 
Q:  you probably want us to move in together? 
A:  it doesn't scare me! 
Q:  yeah, well, it scares me! i mean i not even divorced yet, chandler. you know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um... 
A:  oh, no, no, no, don't go! i've scared ya'! i've said too much! i'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!  Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.  Commercial Break 
Q:  honey, this will help.  
A:  so, i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down. 
Q:  that is never good. 
A:  then i got all needy and clingy. 
Q:  okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it? 
A:  she said she'd call me. 
Q:  ohh!  
A:  oh god. 
Q:  welcome to our side of the tunnel. 
A:  this ice cream tastes like crap by the way. 
Q:  yeah, you do. 
A:  so, you don't think i'm terminal? 
Q:  well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control. 
A:  okay, okay. so, should i call her? 
Q:  right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof. 
A:  so i'm not, not gonna lose her? 
Q:  oooh, honey, you're not a total loser. 
A:  i said, 'so i'm not gonna lose her?' 
Q:   no, thank you.  Chandler! 
A:   hello, janice. 
Q:  what are you doing here? 
A:   oh, just a bit of shopping. how've you been?

A:  here in chelsea. 
Q:  who's party is it? 
A:  a woman's 
Q:  what woman?! 
A:   chelsea. 
Q:  okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?  
A:  can i be that guy? 
Q:  chandler and joey's, chandler is laying on the counter and rachel and monica are comforting him again.] 
A:  ....and then i just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store. 
Q:  my god! chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'. 
A:  i've actually ruined this haven't i? it's time for the good ice cream now, right? 
Q:  you know what, everything's gonna be okay.  
A:   hello. hi, janice! can you hold on for a second? Okay.  Okay, what do I do?

Q:  yes, and grumpy. 
A:  what are you, stop naming dwarves!  hello, janice. hi, i'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry.  Really?!  Really?! 
Q:  he's soo lucky, if janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now. 
A:   i love you too. 
Q:  no. y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail. 
A:  yeah! 
Q:  well, i started building one. but then i decided to take it to the next step.

Q:  her what? 
A:  well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one cant get mad. 
Q:  so, chandler, whos on your list? 
A:  ah, kim basinger, cindy crawford, halle berry, yasmine bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit. 
Q:  now, you do realize that shes a cartoon, and way out of your league? 
A:  i know, i know, i just always wondered if i could get her eyes to pop out of her head. 
Q:  hardy boy. 
A:  peter parker. 
Q:  well i-i-i, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. first, Ill divide my perspective canidates into catergories.... 
A:   what a geek! 
Q:  chandler. 
A:  hi. 
Q:  hey, how do you guys get anything done? 
A:  we dont, really. 
Q:  yeah, i was thinking that maybe we could go down to time square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker. 
A:  you know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city. 
Q:  oh, im sorry. did i get ya? 
A:  no, you didnt get me!! its an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!! 
Q:  calm down, do you want this unit or not? 
A:  i do not want this unit!!

Q:  and!! isabella rosselini. 
A:  ooh-hoo. very hot, very sexy. but ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around. 
Q:  so? 
A:  so, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time. 
Q:  which you just gave up really quickly. 
A:   have you seen joey? 
Q:  whats the matter? 
A:  oh, just this!  Yknow what its my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish. 
Q:   hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles. 
A:  whats going on? 
Q:  hes retiling my floor.  
A:  yo!! spackel boy! get up!

Q:  heavy thing, not getting lighter! 
A:  okay, one...two... 
Q:  all right!!

Q:  why?! how?! how is he a genius?

Q:  and before you know it, she's with him. and you'll be all, 'ohh, man!' and he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'

Q:  you think?! god, i, ah, im in hell. i mean what, what am i gonna do? Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this. And all I can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say? when I tell her what I did. 
A:  well, before we answer that, i think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you? 
Q:  look, ross look, im on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble. 
A:  hes right. nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just gonna hurt her. 
Q:  yeah, but dont you think.... 
A:  all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for. 
Q:  oh, i-i dont think theres any trail. 
A:  okay, okay-okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issacs sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebes friends with Rachel. And thats the trail, I did it!

Q:  oh yeah, come here.  
A:  oh, thats mature. 
Q:  what? 
A:  nothing, nothing. 
Q:  oh, i knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday. 
A:  yeah, well, i guess they had a fight, and he got drunk.... 
Q:  oh!!  you guys knew about this and you didnt tell us?! 
A:   he has sex, and we get hit in our heads.

A:   wax the door shut, were never leaving, ever.  
Q:  we could eat the wax! its organic. 
A:  oh great, food with hair on it.

A:  lets go.  
Q:  guys. i thought you were taking ross to the game? 
A:  we are. hes meeting us here. 
Q:  well ross was hangin out over at our place, rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler.... 
A:  yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? rachel came over to borrow something. 
Q:  whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow. 
A:  y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts. 
Q:  oh, i had the opposite dream.

A:  nope, hymn 253, his eyes are on the sparrow! when my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.  
Q:  chandler! youre smoking? what are you doing?! 
A:  hey, shut up!! youre not my real mom!! 
Q:  look, you guys i just wanna say, i really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. Its been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks. 
A:  can somebody else hug him? i have to stay by the window. 
Q:  pity food? y'know what thats okay, all right, i dont need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays. 
A:  well, then, i might as well offer to stay. 
Q:  why? do you think hes still mad at us? 
A:   well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.

A:   and is this in case the house sneezes? 
Q:  i-i know. well if something comes up...  
A:  oh, i'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase. 
Q:  okay, my boss, joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you... 
A:  oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? dug my action, did she? checkin out the Chan-Chan man! 
Q:   that was  surreal. okay, what do think? are you interested at all?

Q:  ahhhh!! 
A:   hey, my fathers house does that! 
Q:   o-o-o-okay, how did it go? tell me everything. 
A:  well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening. 
Q:  hmm. 
A:  of course, i didnt get to enjoy any of that, because Joannas such a big, dull dud! 
Q:  yep. i just, i just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this.  
A:   im telling ya, joannas got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime. Ill give you a call. 
Q:  ohh, gee. i wonder why she thinks youre going to call her? 
A:  thats what you say at the end of a date. 
Q:  you cant just say, nice to meet you, good night? 
A:  to her face? look its the end of the date, im standing there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion. 
Q:   call her! call her now! 
A:  multiple, so many paper cuts. 
Q:  why hasnt he called rachel? why? why? i dont understand. Why? He said hell call. Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out, shes gone crazy! 
A:   oh, well give me the phone then. 
Q:  come on, this isnt funny. she thinks its my fault that you havent called her. You have to call her! 
A:  look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didnt notice, I dont like you! 
Q:  well then youre going to have to take her out again. 
A:  nooo!! shes really dull! and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye! 
Q:  i dont care! i dont care! you are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. And, I dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again! 
A:  all right! fine! but its just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody ever again! 
Q:  thats fine! 
A:  thats just a lot of big talk, y'know. 
Q:  rachels office, chandler and joanna are returning from their lunch date. He is telling her about her mascara problem. Rachel is already there.] 
A:  its not a big deal. its, just its right here,  and its all the time. 
Q:  well, thanks again for lunch. 
A:   yes, this, this was pleasant.  
Q:  it was, wasnt it?

A:  so take care. 
Q:  you too. 
A:  well, this was great. ill give you a call. we should do it again sometime.  
Q:   chandler!! are you gonna call her! 
A:  noo! 
Q:  chandler!! 
A:  look, im sorry. okay? im weak, and pathetic, and sorry. 
Q:  okay, you are going to tell her and youre going to tell her now.  
A:  ahhhhim not going to call you. 
Q:  what? 
A:  im sorry. im-im-im sorry that i said i was going to when Im not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isnt Rachels fault. Its me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. And Im really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out. 
Q:  well, this isnt how i was hoping how this would end, but i guess i have to appreciate your honesty. 
A:  yeah, o-okay. 
Q:  so... 
A:  well this is great! ill give you a call! we should do it again sometime!  Closing Credits

A:   joey kept screaming at me, do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.

Q:  pretty nice? 
A:  youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this. 
Q:  we dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.

A:  all right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!

Q:  well, last time i almost got fired. you must end it, you must end it now! 
A:  oh, come on! its not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually Im pretty much just in there by myself.

Q:  kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. i thought we had a deal. 
A:  hey, look, what do you want from me? 
Q:  i want you to like her! but if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend. 
A:  i am pretending. 
Q:  well then, do it better! 
A:  okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!

A:  well, i have a call in about that. 
Q:  'kay. 
A:  actually, this is for kathy's birthday. it's an early edition of her favorite book. 
Q:  oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real! 
A:  okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. 
Q:  huh. well, then you'd better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. How did you get that? 
A:  oh, it wasn't a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. 
Q:  yeah, and what a great way to say, "i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!" 
A:  it doesn't say that. does it? 
Q:  how do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange? 
A:  okay, all right, i'll just uh, make sure that uh, joey gets her something really great. 
Q:  ahahaha... haha.. yes i can, of course. excuse me. 
A:  it's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday? 
Q:  you know what we should all do? go see a musical. 
A:   sure... 
Q:  and you know which one we should see? the 1996 tony award winner. do you happen to know the name of that one?

Q:  yes! rent! 
A:  okay, so when do you want to go? 
Q:   hey. man, it is so hard to shop for girls. 
A:  yes, it is, at office max. 
Q:  what did you get her?  
A:  a pen. 
Q:  it's two gifts in one. it's a pen that's also a clock! huh? 
A:  huh-huh! you can't give her that. 
Q:  why not? 
A:  because she's not eleven! and it's not the seventh night of hanukkah! 
Q:  sure it is! she needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!" 
A:  all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday? 
Q:  she didn't have a birthday while we were going out. 
A:  for three years?

A:  all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay?

A:  would you like me to write her a little poem as well? 
Q:  monica and rachel, rachel is there, chandler enters.] 
A:  okay, all right. i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit. 
Q:  any luck? 
A:  oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called "invisible things for Kathy."  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff? 
Q:  all right, look. why don't you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen. 
A:  she's really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her. 
Q:  aw, honey, that's so sweet. 
A:  yeah? you don't think it's just pathetic?

Q:   a book?  is it like a book that's also a safe? 
A:  no, it's a book that's just a book, okay? it's an early edition of the velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay? 
Q:  you got it. thanks man. thanks for doing this, i owe you one.  Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? 
A:  no, it came out to an even twenty. 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey, how'd it go? how'd she like the gift? 
Q:  oh, man, she loved it! she's over there showing monica and rachel right now. 
A:  oh yeah? that's great! 
Q:  hey, listen, i gotta tell ya, i feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this! 
A:   aahhuuhhh....  
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! happy birthday. 
Q:  you know, uh...  chandler got you a gift, too. 
A:  no he didn't.  
Q:  yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! ha-ho-ho! 
A:  happy birthday! i'm sorry. 
Q:  you really didn't have to.  wow. 
A:  see, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock. 
Q:  yeah. no, this is great. thank you, chandler. . 
A:  oh, yeah... yeah. 
Q:  oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. . 
A:   goodnight. 
Q:  um, thank you for the gift. 
A:  oh, uh, yeah... i just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time. 
Q:  no, i... i didn't mean the pen. thank you for the book. 
A:  uh, the book? 
Q:  the velveteen rabbit. i kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it. 
A:  what do you mean? 
Q:  well, uh, when joey gave it to me, he said, "this is 'cause i know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find. 
A:   uhl..ell. by the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell." 
Q:  you must really like... joey... to go to all that trouble for him. 
A:  oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend. 
Q:  well.... 
A:  goodnight.  
Q:  y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a big surprise. 
A:  it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows. Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, shes smooth! Smooth!   
Q:  great!  
A:   hey-hey-hey! who was that? 
Q:  that would be casey. were going out tonight. 
A:  goin out, huh? wow! wow!  so things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer. 
Q:  no, things are fine with kathy. im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey. 
A:   what? 
Q:  yeah-yeah. and the craziest thing is that i just ate a whole pizza by myself!  
A:  wait! youre going out with kathy! 
Q:  yeah. why are you getting so upset? 
A:  well, im upsetfor you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.  
Q:  what is the big deal? its not like were exclusive. 
A:  look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you. 
Q:  you got all that from the back of her head? 
A:  all right look, i think its time for you to settle down. y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane. 
Q:  okay, guys. 
A:  all right! bring it on, you 
Q:  here we go.  yknow, ive-ive never played my stuff for anyone before, so its important that-that you understand its about communicating very private emotions.  Yknow, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. Thats what Im 
A:   oh my god! play!  
Q:   boy, that was-that was, umm terrific. 
A:  really, bitchin! 
Q:  what are you guys talking about, i loved it! it was soo moving. oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear. 
A:  you mean like, music? 
Q:  chandler and joey's, chandler is watching yasmein bleeth running on tv, and the duck starts quacking.] 
A:  yeah, i know what youre thinkin! yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.  
Q:   hey!  oh god, is that baywatch? 
A:  uh yes, but uh, i just watch it for the articles. 
Q:  so is joey around? 
A:  no-no, hes not back yet, but hell be here any minute. so uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?

A:  what happened? 
Q:  we broke down on the parkway, so i have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Ill be there as soon as I can. 
A:  why cant you tell her? 
Q:  cause i only have one quarter, and i think my time is about to 
A:  joey! joey!! 
Q:  yeah? 
A:  i thought your time ran out. 
Q:  me too, but i guess i do have a couple of more 
A:   uhh, that was joey. hes running a little late, he says hes sorry. 
Q:  oh. 
A:  so i guess its just uh, you and me then. 
Q:  oh, okay. 
A:  yeah, i think it is! 
Q:  so what did you do today? 
A:  oh, i had an appointment to get my haircut 
Q:   oh, it looks great! 
A:  and then it got canceled. 
Q:  well, i could cut it. 
A:  really?! you do that? 
Q:  yeah, i do. of course, i learned at my aunts dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say? 
A:  dog grooming huh? okay, just dont make my tail too poofy.

A:  what? 
Q:  yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. i just figured we hit a dog. 
A:  okay. 
Q:  listen uh, could you put kathy on, i wanna apologize. 
A:  oh yeah man.  joey.

A:  no-no-no-no, this is bad! its bad! this is bad! 
Q:  horrible! 
A:  wait the uh, the kiss or the situation? 
Q:  no-no-no, the kiss was good. 
A:  okay! 
Q:  no, but thats bad! 
A:  ooh! yes! okay! heres what we do, we-we forget it happened. 
Q:  what?! 
A:  okay, we-we swallow our feelings. even if it means were unhappy forever. Sound good? 
Q:  can you really do that? 
A:  i have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him. 
Q:  chandler, i like joey a lot, but with you 
A:   oh-no-no-no! dont! dont! see-see, youre getting me confused, Im starting to urn. 
Q:  im sorry. if you wanna pretend that nothing happened, i can try. 
A:  i-i think we have too. 
Q:  okay. bye. 
A:  bye.  Are you still out there? 
Q:  aww man! i cant believe i locked myself out again!  
A:  hang on buddy!  
Q:   oh my god! what happened here? did you do all this? 
A:  i sure did. 
Q:  why? 
A:  well, i just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend. 
Q:  well, youre amazing. 
A:  oh no-no-no. this is amazing.  
Q:   a tv as if it appears from nowhere! thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? 
A:  well, yknow im 29. i mean who needs a savings account. 
Q:  oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. 
A:  oh, i dont know. 
Q:  oh-no-no-no, you are! you do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that. 
A:  you mean with casey. 
Q:  no-no-no, i think im gonna see how things go with kathy. shes pretty cool. 
A:  or casey. 
Q:  no-no, kathy. 
A:  could be casey. 
Q:  no. no, kathy. 
A:  consider casey. 
Q:  yknow what i think? i think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think? 
A:  that all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! 
Q:  yeah! joey has the best boyfriend ever! 
A:  i kissed kathy. 
Q:  does joey know? 
A:  no. is there anyway, anyway you think hell understand this? 
Q:  no the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside. 
A:  oh, dont say that! dont say that. thats not true. is it? 
Q:  he loves you. 
A:  then why didnt you tell me to do that?!! 
Q:  i remember you did. 
A:  god!!  what am i gonna do?! 
Q:  well, chandler, youre gonna have to tell him. 
A:  why?! why do i have to tell him?! 
Q:  because you do. 
A:  yeah, i know. 
Q:  chandler and joey's, joey is watching tv as chandler enters.] 
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey! samboucha margarita? 
A:  is that a real thing? 
Q:  well, we only had samboucha, so it is now. 
A:  listen ah, joe, i-i need to, i need to talk to you about something. 
Q:  whats up? 
A:  its-its about kathy. umm, uh, i like her. i like her a lot actually. 
Q:  you do? 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  well, youre timing couldnt be better. shes not my girlfriend anymore. 
A:  what? 
Q:  yeah, she broke up with me. 
A:  oh uh, when? 
Q:  just now, after acting class. at first i thought she was doing some kind of scene, thats why I let people watch. 
A:  oh man, i am so sorry. are, are you okay? 
Q:  well, ive been better. but, im all right. so you like her huh? 
A:  yes, but i-i uh, dont have too. 
Q:  no-no-no, no its uh, its okay. 
A:  yeah? 
Q:  yeah. you know why? cause you came to me first. 
A:  well, i thought that would be the best thing to do. 
Q:  but hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy. So 
A:  see uh, thats-thats actually what i wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is. 
Q:  who? 
A:  its me. im the other guy. 
Q:  what? 
A:  yeah, i mean when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking, and one thing to another and 
Q:  and what?! did you sleep with her?! 
A:  no! no! no! i just kissed her. 
Q:  what?!! thats even worse!! 
A:  how is that worse?! 
Q:  i dont know! but its the same! 
A:  look, im sorry! but theres nothing i can do, i think Im in love with her! 
Q:  who cares?! you went behind my back! i would never do that to you! 
A:  youre right, i have no excuses! i was totally over the line. 
Q:  over the line?! you-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you! 
A:  yes. yes! right! and i feel horrible. you have to believe me! 
Q:  is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that Im not gonna eat! You know why?! 
A:  probably because 
Q:   hello. 
A:  look i never should have kissed your girlfriend, but im    
Q:  monica and rachel's, everyone but joey and chandler are there getting ready for Thanksgiving.] 
A:   aww, turkey! aww, giving thanks! aww! 
Q:  so are things with you and joey any better? 
A:  they couldnt be worse. i spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me. 
Q:  i know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, i just  
A:  hey, by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa, cause I wanna trade for her. 
Q:  i picked her! oh thank god you want her! ooh! 
A:  wow! why do you want to get rid of her so badly? 
Q:  because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, lets trade! 
A:  oh thats not true! thats not true! i got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it  Her initials 
Q:  well, maybe you could give to somebody else. ooh, like ross geller. 
A:  op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase. 
Q:  who cares? he works in a museum! 
A:  hey, what time is it? the big game is about to start! 
Q:  you dont have to do that, ross and joey arent here, you can watch the parade if you want. 
A:  thanks. 
Q:   people are trying to sleep in here! 
A:  monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts. 
Q:  oh, yknow what, i cant, it really kills. 
A:  well maybe you should put some ice on it. 
Q:  no, my eye doctor is richard! i cant go to him when i dont have a boyfriend! 
A:  hes really picky about his patients. 
Q:  okay, get out of my kitchen! 
A:   all right! okay! i think i am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it. 
Q:  so listen ah, i picked monica for secret santa, but im already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch. 
A:  oh yknow what, i was already trying to trade for ah, well, you. 
Q:  really?! wow! thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me? 
A:  i dont know r.g., i was thinking something girlie for your office. 
Q:  yeah, well maybe phoebe will switch with me. 
A:  oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets. 
Q:  oh, thats not true! ive got her lots of stuff she never took back. 
A:  like? 
Q:  like uh, that gold necklace i got her last year. 
A:  when was the last time you saw her wear it? 
Q:  well, she wore it all christmas day, and then uh 
A:  big dog? 
Q:  oh my god, is it really that bad? 
A:  i walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words. 
Q:  oh. 
A:  hey joe. 
Q:  chandler and joey's, joey is packing as chandler rushes in.] 
A:  hey! im sorry! that where are you going? 
Q:  my folks. 
A:  oh, uh, when-when are you coming back? 
Q:  i dont know. i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment. 
A:  what?! 
Q:  yeah, yknow at first i thought we could talk about this yknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I 
A:  hey, look, what do you want me to say? do you want me to say that Ill stop seeing her? 
Q:  look, its not about her. okay? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend. So, Ill see ya.  
A:  hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend, i just-i just screwed up! 
Q:  yeah! you did! and thats why im leaving.  
A:  all right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all! 
Q:  when that guy was robbing us, and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down! 
A:  what? 
Q:  yeah! but if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around! 
A:  all right, wait! come on! just wait one second! there has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What? 
Q:  ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew! 
A:   sounds like a really bad idea to me. 
Q:  chandler? 
A:  the meaning of the box is three fold. one , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts! 
Q:    now, well see. 
A:  air hole! air hole!!  
Q:  and rachel.  and thats chandler. 
A:  how do ya do. 
Q:  hes doin some thinkin!  
A:  what happened? what happened?! 
Q:  oh, ill get it.  
A:  gotcha!  
Q:  that doesnt sound like thinking to me! 
A:  sorry! 
Q:  yknow i dont think you should be talking at all in there! i think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes! 
A:  okay, okay, you got it! 
Q:  okay, fine.   
A:  you cant tell, but im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys! 
Q:  all right, look! if this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box! 
A:  youre right, and im sorry! this means a lot to me! i want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight. 
Q:  so are you gonna start taking this thing seriously? 
A:  absolutely! 
Q:  he can still catch her! come on, get out of there!  get out of there! 
A:  so? 
Q:  yeah, were gonna be fine! get out! 
A:  yeah? 
Q:  yeah, you did some real good thinkin in there.

Q:  yeah! all right? lets go! 
A:  and may-maybe we could end up on a boat again? 
Q:  yeah!!! 
A:  all right!! 
Q:   hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat? 
A:  remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  well, those were seals, man. 
Q:  all right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and well head back out. 
A:  yeah, all right. 
Q:  im kinda beat. 
A:  actually, me too. 
Q:  yeah, me too. 
A:  actually, can i get some hot water with a little lemon? i think i strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud? 
Q:  yeah, i know. 
A:  yknow what? were not sad, were not sad, were just not 21 anymore. Yknow? Im 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour! 
Q:  oh, on a date. yeah, i met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.  
A:  oh, yeah! how did you meet her? 
Q:  okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and i sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy. 
A:  were you so late because you were burring this woman? 
Q:  no, im getting back down cause she lives in poughkeepsie. she seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away. 
A:  how can she be great if shes from poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany. 
Q:  central perk, chandler, joey, rachel, and phoebe are there.] 
A:  hey, look at this!  theyre lighting the big Christmas tree tonight. 
Q:  umm, that papers two weeks old. 
A:  all right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! i really wanted to take Kathy to this, I cant believe I missed it. 
Q:  hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! i hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know itll be Valentines Day, then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody!  Yknow, I want a man!!  I mean, it doesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would be great. 
A:  really?! i didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling. 
Q:  well, i know what im giving you for christmas. 
A:  yknow what? theres some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up? 
Q:  yeah! wait a minute, its been a long time that ive been single. How come you never offered this before? 
A:  well, i have a girlfriend, im-im happy. so, i no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy. 
Q:  okay! no accountants. oh, and no one from like legal. i dont like guys with boring jobs. 
A:  oh and ross was like what? a lion tamer?  
Q:  i would love too, but i cant! i mean i just cant, you know that Im not good at confrontation. 
A:  hey, you know what you can do? i remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whos boss. 
Q:  hey! that must be why i got fired last week! does this orson wells guy direct Burger King commercials?

A:  well, like father, like son. 
Q:  patrick and i had such a great time last night! i mean i think this could maybe turn into something serious. 
A:  really?! i-i thought you werent looking for something serious? i thought you were looking for some kind of a fling. 
Q:  well, y'know, possibly.  you didnt tell him that, though? Right? 
A:  ummmmmmmm, no. 
Q:  you told this guy that i was looking for a fling?! you dont tell the guy that!

A:  bad dream? 
Q:  i wasnt sleeping. 
A:  oh yeah, then uh, what was phoebes song about? 
Q:  umm, well i had a similar problem when i lived in prague. 
A:  prague? 
Q:  chandler! patrick just uh, ended things with me. did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship? 
A:  i did! i absolutely did! 
Q:  you idiot!! 
A:  im sure youre right, but why? 
Q:  you dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious relationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away! 
A:  oh, man. im sorry, im so-so sorry. 
Q:  yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to people! 
A:  i know! i know! 
Q:  oh! see just im right back where i started! aww, this sucks! being alone, sucks!  
A:  well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody! Youre a great catch! Yknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnt have to lie once.  
Q:  really? 
A:  yeah! you graduated magma ku laude, right? 
Q:  no. 
A:  oh, it doesnt matter.  hey, yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna come with me? 
Q:  cute guys in little shorts? sure. 
A:  well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry canadians with no teeth. 
Q:  well that sounds fun too.   
A:  have you ever been with a woman? 
Q:  what?! chandler, what is the matter with you?! 
A:  so there is no good time to ask that question. 
Q:   hey! you guys! check it out, check it out!  Guess which job I got. 
A:  i dont know, but donald trump wants his blue blazer black.  
Q:  what? 
A:  blue blazer back. he-he wants it back. 
Q:  but you-you said black. why would he want his blue blazer black? 
A:  well, you-you know what i meant. 
Q:  no, you messed it up. youre stupid. 
A:  so what job did you get joe? 
Q:  well, they said that i had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? Im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give. 
A:  youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a sony play Station? 
Q:  umm,  i love this touchy. can i take it to work with me? 
A:  oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway. it can with the pants. 
Q:  you guys are really right there arent you? 
A:  yes. right where? 
Q:  in the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex and talking and 
A:  yeah, you-you gotta love the talking. 
Q:  and the sex? 
A:  all right, we havent had sex yet. okay, whats the big deal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level. 
Q:  why? just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?! 
A:  no, hes right, im totally lying.  
Q:  then what is it? 
A:  well, kathys last boyfriend was joey. 
Q:  and youre afraid you wont be able to fill his shoes. 
A:  no, im afraid i wont be able to make love as well as him. 
Q:  yeah, i was going for the metaphor. 
A:  yes, and i was saying the actual words. 
Q:  so big deal, so joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed. 
A:  we share a wall! so either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot. 
Q:  sweetie, with you its gonna be different. the sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love. 
A:  yeah? 
Q:  go on. 
A:  all right, all right, ill go sleep with my girlfriend. but Im just doing it for you guys. 
Q:  monica and rachel's, the next morning, phoebe is there with her puppy and is trying to sing it to sleep as Chandler enters.] 
A:  hi. 
Q:  hey! 
A:  why is phoebe singing to carl mulden? 
Q:   so, did you do it? 
A:  yes, yes, we had the sex. 
Q:  uh-oh, it was bad? 
A:  it was fine, yknow? but she didnt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, Im all right with it." 
Q:  yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that. 
A:  look, you have to help me! okay? i mean, i know what to do with a woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodys killing her in there!" 
Q:  all right, im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont know. Rach, give me that pad, please?  All right. Now 
A:  look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! shes hot! 
Q:  now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven! 
A:   there are seven?! 
Q:  let me see that.  oh, yeah. 
A:   thats one? 
Q:  its kind of an important one! 
A:  oh, yknow-yknow what, i was looking at it upside down. 
Q:   now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp. 
A:  that-thats bad? 
Q:  well if you go to disneyland, you dont spend the whole day on the Materhorn. 
A:  well you might if it were anything like 7! 
Q:  what is that noise? 
A:  you!

Q:  yeah.  i bet you cant guess what color my tonsils are? Ill bet the apartment! 
A:  oh, i would never bet this apartment. its too nice. 
Q:   hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  well, freaked. cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alices like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket. 
A:  yeah, but i bet it works. 
Q:   Oh my God! I cant believe you guys are actually think youre moving in here!

A:  cool, girl roommate.  
Q:  dont blame the questions! 
A:  would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us! 
Q:  monica and rachel's, erm, chandler and joey's, theyre both unpacked. the big ceramic dog has found a new home in front of the window. Joey screams and runs into the living room.] 
A:  what?! what-what is it?! 
Q:  did you see the size of the closets?! 
A:  i cant believe we live here!  
Q:  people can hear you. 
A:  i know!!  
Q:  that is one good looking man! 
A:  is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?! 
Q:  well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy. 
A:  yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it! 
Q:  thats a good idea for a business! 
A:  im totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itll be like, "So wheres your boyfriend, whats-his-name, Chester?" And shell go, "No-no-no, its Chandler." And hell go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!" 
Q:   that-that is a good trick. 
A:  all right, look, look, what am i gonna do? 
Q:  well okay, so then youre fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble. 
A:  really? 
Q:  monica and rachel's, erm, chandler and joey's, the gang minus monica and rachel are eating breakfast. Ross and Chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.] 
A:  so uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight? 
Q:  yknow what, i dont know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend. 
A:  yeah, i know but 
Q:  no-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer. 
A:  okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Im fairly certain are the same thing. 
Q:  kathys play, ross and chandler are waiting for her in the lobby after the play.] 
A:  im right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means! 
Q:  all right, lets not jump to any conclusions. all right? there was some sexual chemistry between them. 
A:  come on, it was like cousins having sex up there! 
Q:  its a good play, isnt it?  
A:  oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly youre having sex with him. 
Q:  clearly, im having sex with him? 
A:  oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two! 
Q:  okay, so let me just get this straight. youre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance? 
A:  yknow, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing. 
Q:  acting! chandler, this is my job! im-im playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?! 
A:  well, you can understand, given how we started. 
Q:  oh, wow. i cant believe youre throwing that in my face. 
A:  well, that is what happened, and i dont even see you denying this! 
Q:  ill tell you what, chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up! 
A:  yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon! Commercial Break 
Q:  oh, are we gonna trash that place?  
A:  steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy! 
Q:  so you were right? 
A:  i confronted her, and she didnt deny it!  i dont live here!  
Q:  are you sure? 
A:  well, i may be drunk, but i know what she said! then i went over to beefsteak Julies 
Q:  beefsteak charlies? 
A:  yes! see you and i have always been like 
Q:  monica and rachel's, erm, chandler and joey's, ross, joey, and phoebe are watching a movie as Chandler comes in from his bedroom.] 
A:  did she call? 
Q:  no, sorry. 
A:  all right, maybe i should call her. 
Q:  hes right, what she did was unforgivable. 
A:  well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if i was wrong? 
Q:  how might you be wrong? 
A:  well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy? 
Q:  dude, tell me she actually told you this. 
A:  she did not have to tell me, i saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross! 
Q:  thats all youre basing this on? 
A:  thats not backing me up! look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat. 
Q:  whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry. 
A:  oh my god!! 
Q:   hey. 
A:  hey. i just, i just wanted to come over to-to say that im sorry. Yknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset. 
Q:  oh wow. i really wish youd call me. 
A:  yeah, i know, i-i wish i had too, but yknow i-i think this is a good thing. Y'know? Cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Yknow, I know for me Nicks pants? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  yeah. well, i think our second fight is going to be a big one! 
Q:  howd it go? 
A:  well, she wasnt sleeping with him. 
Q:  oh good! 
A:  she is now. 
Q:  what are you saying? 
A:  im saying that she is a devil woman! Yknow I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I dont hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really. 
Q:  how? how is your fault? 
A:  because, i-i shouldve called! yknow if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with Nick, and they wouldve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples! 
Q:  great!  
A:  you dont have to stop having fun just because im here. Kathy didnt cheat on all of you.  Well, except you.  
Q:  yeah. 
A:   would you give me one minute!! Please. Opening Credits

A:  y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this. 
Q:  i think you're better than you think you are. 
A:  really? okay, so 
Q:   know when to stop. 
A:  y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay? 
Q:  yeah. all right, i'm gonna go tell dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance. 
A:  right! 
Q:  yeah. you won't be able to take it. 
A:  so uh, now that little chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her? 
Q:  they're gonna call her chandler.

A:  oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! no-no, vomit tux! 
Q:  okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, i was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back. 
A:  well y'know a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs. 
Q:  so chandler, have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend? 
A:  uhh, yeah. she uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him. 
Q:  ohh, he's really shy. i-i dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet. 
A:  yeah, i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet. 
Q:  i dont care! i wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!  
A:  really?! that's what you heard?  you said that? 
Q:  i might've said that.  why is that funny? 
A:  because i'm very happy for him!  and you, you lucky dog! 
Q:  well, emily's willing to work on the relationship. 
A:  yes! 
Q:  i will find a selfless good deed! 'cause i just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right! 
A:   hey, monica? can i ask you a cooking question? 
Q:  sure! 
A:  if you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard? 
Q:  well, y'know i-i-i think i'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend. 
A:  why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.  
Q:  so i asked emily if she would come to new york, and she said yes. 
A:  yes! 
Q:  i told her i'd have to think about it. i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you! 
A:  well, you can't just not see rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends. 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  that's true! 
Q:  yeah, but you've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life. 
A:  that's true! 
Q:  oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?  
A:  hey, there he is! there he is! 
Q:   now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs  
A:  how many times have i told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel! 
Q:   hi chandler. 
A:  hey! 
Q:  uh, listen, i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day. 
A:  oh that was yours? uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars. 
Q:  william sonoma, fall catalog, page 27. 
A:  expect it in 4-6 weeks.  umm, hey, umm, joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves. 
Q:  yeah, so? 
A:  well i just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had. 
Q:  y'know what, champ? i think i'll pass. 
A:  why? 
Q:  why?  
A:  what's your point? 
Q:  monica and rachel's, later that day. monica is coming out of the bathroom carrying her cleaning gear.] 
A:   look, maybe i got carried away before. but there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best. 
Q:  keep talking. 
A:  i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH MY GOD. 
Q:  really? 
A:  oh-aw my god! now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex! 
Q:  well, if we owe it?  Oh my When is Joey gonna be home? 
A:  well, i was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on. 
Q:  but, i just cleaned the bathroom. 
A:  yeah, why don't we lose the gloves. 
Q:  yeah.   
A:  all right, let's show them how it's done. 
Q:  ow! 
A:  y'know that wasn't part of it? 
Q:  never done that before. 
A:  nope. End 
Q:  monica? what time is it? 
A:  uhh, 9.  
Q:  i'm really getting tired of sneaking around. 
A:  i know, me too. hey! y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time. 
Q:  all weekend? that's a whole lotta naked. 
A:  yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing. 
Q:  ohh, i've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey! 
A:  okay, y'know your not though. let's go.  
Q:  oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont. 
A:  i'm not in charge of where the conference is held. do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference. 
Q:  damn! 
A:  what's going on? 
Q:  hi! 
A:  uh, hey! 
Q:  what's going on? 
A:  we're flipping monica's mattress. 
Q:  oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too? 
A:  aww, man!  
Q:   can you hear anything? 
A:  oh yes, somebody just said, "can you hear anything?"  
Q:  ooh, madlibs, mine!  
A:  condoms? 
Q:  you don't know how long we're gonna be in here! we may have to repopulate the Earth. 
A:  and condoms are the way to do that?  
Q:  atlantic city, new jersey, chandler and monica are about to start their weekend of sex, sex, nothing but sex.] 
A:   i can't believe it! we're here! 
Q:  ooh, chocolates on the pillows! i love that! 
A:  oh, you should live with joey, roll-os everywhere. 
Q:  come here.  okay, be right back.  
A:  oh yes! monica, get in here! there's a high-speed car chase on!  
Q:  we're switching rooms. 
A:   oh dear god, they gave us glasses! 
Q:  no, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! i mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we? 
A:  okay, but let's do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it's feed!  
Q:  i think you'll find this room more to your liking. 
A:  okay, great.  
Q:   they say he's only got half a tank left. 
A:  half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do! 
Q:  we're switching rooms again. 
A:  what? why? 
Q:   excuse me, umm, can i talk to you over here for just a second? 
A:  uh-huh.  
Q:  chandler! 
A:   yeah. 
Q:  look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and i'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers! 
A:  i hear ya, mugsy! but look, all these rooms are fine okay? can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.  
Q:  okay, this one i like! 
A:   nothing! it's over! dammit! this is regularly scheduled programming! 
Q:  can we turn the tv off? okay? do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this? 
A:  oh, i'm sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun? 
Q:  hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight! 
A:  oh, who should i blame? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms? 
Q:  i don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas! 
A:  do not speak ill of the dead. 
Q:  we're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you? 
A:  i just want to watch a little television. what is the big deal? geez, relax mom. 
Q:  what did you say? 
A:  i said, "geez, relax monnnnn." 
Q:  chandler and joey's, chandler is returning from his disastrous weekend. he throws his bag down and sits down on one of the leather chairs, but he sits on something and picks it up and throws it away.] 
A:  damn rollos! 
Q:  hey, you're back! 
A:  hey. 
Q:  how was your conference? 
A:  it was terrible. i fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?  
Q:  oh, so your weekend was a total bust? 
A:  uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator. 
Q:  oh, it was awful.  i guess some people just don't appreciate really good food. 
A:  well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea. 
Q:  chandler!  
A:  monica.   
Q:  okay, i'd like to know how much the room was because i'd like to pay my half. 
A:  okay, fine, $300. 
Q:  300 dollars?! 
A:  yeah, just think of it as $25 per room! 
Q:  hi, rach. 
A:  hi! 
Q:  oh no! not that guy! he does look like him though. 
A:  okay, ross is in the bathroom. 
Q:  who cares? you're rachel!  who's kip? 
A:  kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together. 
Q:  chandler and joey's, joey is watching tv.] 
A:   hey! 
Q:  hey, mr. bing. that uh, hotel you stayed at called. said someone left an eyelash curler in your room. 
A:  yes that was mine. 
Q:  'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there. 
A:  yes that would have made more sense. 
Q:  monica and rachel's, monica is doing a crossword puzzle.] 
A:   hey! 
Q:  hi. 
A:  i just came over to drop off nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh? 
Q:  yeah, it did. 
A:  so, i guess this is over. 
Q:  what? 
A:  well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime. 
Q:  why, exactly? 
A:  because of the weekend, we had a fight. 
Q:  chandler that's crazy! if you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!  
A:  so, this isn't over? 
Q:   you are so cute! no. no, it was a fight. you deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about. 
A:  really? okay. great! 
Q:  ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!  
A:   we're in a relationship? 
Q:  i'm afraid so. 
A:  okay.  
Q:   oh! ohh! oh!! 
A:  joey, can i talk to you for a second?  
Q:  ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! 
A:  yes. yes.  
Q:  how?! when?! 
A:  it happened in london. 
Q:  in london!!! 
A:  the reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. 
Q:  but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!  
A:  no-no-no-no-no! you can't! 
Q:  i guess i'm done. 
A:  fun's over! 
Q:  look, just because i know about you two, doesn't mean i like looking at it. 
A:  aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour? 
Q:  sorry. 
A:  sorry.  
Q:  hey! 
A:  hello! 
Q:  yeah! why would my mother send me a fur? doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make! 
A:  yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up! 
Q:  look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, I'm sure everything will be fine. 
A:  okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme? 
Q:  oh, i hate this. everything's changing. 
A:  yeah i know, we're losing ross, joey said hence 
Q:  ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  enh? all right, what do you think? 
A:  you're on in 5 ms. minnelli. 
Q:  that's way uptown! that's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail! 
A:  so you're really okay with this? 
Q:  yes! yes! i mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, i'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time! 
A:  now that's so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.  
Q:   i know i miss you too. i can't wait to see you. i love you. Bye.  
A:  okay, what is in here? rocks? 
Q:  no-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. 
A:  so, rocks.  
Q:  yeah! 
A:  look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable. 
Q:  i kinda feel like it's my fault.  
A:  kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened. 
Q:  well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!  
A:  well, i think it's very brave what you said.  
Q:  all right, i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places.  
A:  pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing? 
Q:  ross's now empty apartment, he is spackling some holes shut as the gang comes to apologize.] 
A:  uh, ross? 
Q:  look, ross, i feel really bad. i mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk. 
A:  yeah, we are so sorry. 
Q:  hi emily! 
A:  hi! 
Q:  she's there?! 
A:  oh yeah, there-there she is! 
Q:  no, look.  
A:  that's a pig. 
Q:  i know, i know, but look at the knobs on her.  
A:  hey!  
Q:  emily's cousin kicked me out! 
A:  what?! 
Q:  well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back. 
A:  how can he do that? didn't you sign a lease? 
Q:  hey, you can stay with us! we'll take care of ya! 
A:  oh, yeah! absolutely! anything you need man! but you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair! 
Q:  what? 
A:  he thought you said gonad.  Opening Credits 
Q:   hey roomies! 
A:  love what you've done with the place. 
Q:  not a problem. and listen, hey! since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine. 
A:  oh yeah! 
Q:   you're fake laughing too, right? 
A:  oh, the tears are real. 
Q:  hey. 
A:  what are you doing? 
Q:  nothing. 
A:  you built a fort didn't ya? 
Q:   kinda. 
A:   oh my god, the air purifier! ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was  
Q:  dude, you should've gone out once and a while. 
A:  i hate this thing! 
Q:  ahhhhhhhhhh , and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver. Well, there is an accompanying face, but I don't want to try and describe it as well.) 
A:   hello children! 
Q:  hey! wanna play some foosball? please? 
A:  okay.  
Q:  all right, i have one question. what is the deal with this?  
A:  bye-bye little puppet joey hand? 
Q:  no, the quiet down thing! 
A:  you mean this.  
Q:  um-hmm! look, i-i-i don't know how much more of this i can take! did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn? 
A:   all right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him! 
Q:  all right, i guess i can hold out a little longer. let's have a game. 
A:  okay.  
Q:   uh fellas,  
A:  okay, so he's out of here. 
Q:  central perk, chandler, joey, and ross are there. chandler and joey are looking through the paper.] 
A:  well, i-i-i'm done with this. you want anything ross? sports? International? Apartment listings? 
Q:  well, i guess i can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here. 
A:  not even on page 7? 
Q:   oh yeah! you'rehey, you're right! here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks! 
A:  what about that circled one? 
Q:  but it's available now! isn't it? 
A:  yes, it is. 
Q:  okay! 
A:  there we go! 
Q:  oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, i was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it. 
A:  let's go quicker. 
Q:  oh my god!  
A:  yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub. 
Q:  but hey, ross, this place is available now! 
A:  yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks. 
Q:   how about you? 
A:  it's a kitchen slash bathroom. 
Q:  all right, i see what you guys are saying. i'll uh, i'll go downstairs and fill out an application.  
A:  we are bad people. 
Q:  maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping ross get back on his feet! 
A:  yes that was a nice place! 
Q:  yeah! 
A:  not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag! 
Q:  yeah!  
A:  what are we gonna do? 
Q:  i don't know. maybe pizza? 
A:  about ross! 
Q:  hello!  oh yeah!  it's the apartment manager; ross put us down as references.  Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable. 
A:   of course he has this big huge dog! that uh, barks into the night.  Well, who doesn't love dogs?  Ah, he's a tap dancer!  Yes, some would say that is a lost art.  He's a pimp!  There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp!  Hello?  
Q:  chandler and joey's, ross still has boxes all over the place. joey is wearing a football helmet, and Chandler is spinning him around in one of the chairs and counting.] 
A:  98. 99. 100. okay, go! 
Q:   dude, i'm telling ya! i'm fine!   
A:  here we go! here we go!  
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  you're kidding! 
A:  you're kidding, no! 
Q:  well, we got plenty of space! there-there's still some over there  by-by that speaker. Please, just stay! 
A:  yeah! 
Q:  definitely! 
A:  yes! ross, you have to stay! 
Q:  all right! 
A:  all right, buddy! 
Q:  chandler and joey's and ross's, chandler is entering and when he closes the door Joey pops his head out of the fort like before, but this time he's wearing a cowboy hat.] 
A:  well, i see you've had a very productive day. don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much? 
Q:   come on, it's fun! 
A:  all right!  Isn't this a woman's hat? 
Q:  that's very nice. 
A:  that's sweet, joey. 
Q:  i mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. i mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there? 
A:  are you aware that you're still talking? 
Q:  i'm sorry. it's just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever. 
A:  no-no-no! i am the king of bad thanksgivings. you can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me. 
Q:  oh, come on! i wanna hear it! it wouldn't be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out! 
A:  it's a tradition, like the parade. if the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.  Thanksgiving 1978 
Q:  i don't know about that. i've got one that's worse. 
A:  really? worse than, "more turkey mr. chandler?" 
Q:  hey, it's not like it sounds. 
A:  it's exactly like it sounds. Thanksgiving 1992 
Q:  okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!  
A:  arghhhhhh!!  
Q:   it worked! i scared ya, i knew it! ha-ha! 
A:  i'm over here big guy. 
Q:  monica and rachel's, continued from earlier.] 
A:   you did look like an idiot. 
Q:  umm, i-i really don't want to tell this story. 
A:  oh, come on monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians. 
Q:  hi, i'm ross's little sister. 
A:   okay. 
Q:  umm, chandler, if you want i can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner. 
A:  well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, i'm in.  
Q:  hey chandler! did you like the macaroni and cheese? 
A:  oh yeah, it was great. you should be a chef. 
Q:  so im thinking about asking rachel out tonight. y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week. 
A:  emotional knapsack? 
Q:  yeah.

A:  i'm intrigued. 
Q:  all right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. 
A:  okay, but be careful okay, because i wanna get our security deposit back.

A:  well, why can't you do them tomorrow? 
Q:  yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work. 
A:   why don't you cut him a little slack? okay? maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done. 
Q:  dude, if you think fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played. 
A:  the only reason you're doing this to joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed. 
Q:  and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend. and if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing. 
A:  oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk? 
Q:  how about we settle this right now!  there! now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha! 
A:  i paid for those tickets! 
Q:  no you didn't. you said you would, but you never did!

A:  yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all THE LIVE LONG DAY!! 
Q:  yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that i finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?

A:  no. no, i just think that maybe i-i'd heard it somewhere before.  
Q:  for this one you'll have to use your imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.)  So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.

A:   ross is wearing leather pants! does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants?  Someone comment on the pants! 
Q:  i like them a lot. 
A:  that's not what i had in mind! see, people like ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.  
Q:  oh see, i-i needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."  
A:  oh come on!!  
Q:   i can't wait to be with you! i'll sneak over as soon as ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.

A:  oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too. 
Q:  all right, check me out. 
A:  okay.  
Q:  central perk, monica is buying a muffin as chandler runs in.] 
A:  hey! everybody at work loved you last night! 
Q:  really? 
A:  and! they like me more just because i was with ya! i think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.  Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet. 
Q:  hey, i thought you already had one. 
A:  oh i used too, but then joey thought it would be fun to go to central park and hit rocks at bigger rocks.  Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet? 
Q:  oh umm, y'know i lent it to joey and i never actually got it back. 
A:  okay, good luck with that.  
Q:  am i on fire today or what?! those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!

A:  let them win one. 
Q:  are you crazy?! we own those two! i mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.

A:  oh yes, sir! put me out of my misery. are you sure you never played pro?   Please let them win! 
Q:  i'll take it down to 95% but that's the best i can do.  
A:  oopsey, missed it! 
Q:  i got it!!  
A:  long!  
Q:  i can't believe you let them win! 
A:  yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.  
Q:  i was frustrated. 
A:  it was my racquet. 
Q:  i was frustrated with you! 
A:  if we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night. 
Q:  y'know what really bothers me? isit's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"  I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up. 
A:  okay y'know what, because you said that, i'm not putting out tonight. 
Q:  oh, none for me. thanks. 
A:  just a little bit of sugar. 
Q:   how does that laugh not give you a headache? 
A:  oh, you get used to it. 
Q:  y'know, i-i-i don't think that i can. so if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things. 
A:  so i laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal? 
Q:  i'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when i can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect. 
A:  oh.  
Q:   uh, i gotta apologize for kara's coffee. y'know, i feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself.  Did you hear what I said Bing? 
A:  what? 
Q:  the joke bing. what's the matter with you? 
A:  well, i-i just didn't think it was funny sir. 
Q:  excuse me? 
A:  well, i just 
Q:   honey, i just don't think that you understood the joke. 
A:  really? 
Q:  yeah! i mean it was really funny, i-i just don't think you got it. you see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey? 
A:  i think i do!  thank you, monica. 
Q:  i thought you could use the help. 
A:  coffee in a fight!

Q:   hey! happy anniversary! 
A:  happy anniversary, 10 months!  
Q:  so umm, when i was in the shower i was thinking about our first night in London 
A:  uhh, joey's grandmother is right there.  
Q:  is that the one that speaks english or the one that doesn't? 
A:  the one that doesn't. 
Q:  that was some hot love you gave me! i'm gonna go get ready. 
A:  hey, why don't you wear those earrings i gave you? 
Q:  that's a great idea! i was saving them for something special. 
A:  okay. 
Q:  oh umm, my big scene is coming up. big scene coming up. 
A:  if you said, "big lima bean, bubbling up." would she understand the difference? 
Q:  y'know, all i'm looking for is the money. 
A:  here you go.  now stop bringing us pizzas you. 
Q:  i'm gonna try.  
A:  you're welcome. 
Q:  you couldn't let me have her, could ya?! 
A:  what? 
Q:  chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl! 
A:  thank you for that!  i was not flirting. 
Q:  really?! 
A:  really?! 
Q:  it's no big deal, i do it all the time. 
A:   so umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time? 
Q:  sure! it doesn't mean anything! just like i know it doesn't mean anything with you! 
A:  okay, but there is a big difference. you are a lot hotter than I am. 
Q:  chandler, this actually bothers you? 
A:  yes, it does bother me! and i think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women? 
Q:   okay, everybody just keep smiling. it'll kill my grandmother if she finds out. 
A:   well, what is it? 
Q:   joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? it's not your fault. 
A:   if we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon? 
Q:  no, it's sam waterston! crimes and misdemeanors, Capricorn One. 
A:  doesn't know, "hello." but she knows capricorn one.  
Q:  ohh! i did not get that.  
A:  so uh monica, do you, do you like the law & order? 
Q:  yeah, it's good. 
A:  see, i'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area! 
Q:  chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me. 
A:  oh, i'm so glad we cleared that up. look, i'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women. 
Q:  go on, teach me something about men and women. 
A:  okay, i've already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!" 
Q:  no way! 
A:  it's true. 
Q:  well that's pathetic! 
A:  again true. 
Q:  and this goes for all guys? 
A:  all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way. 
Q:  joey! 
A:  uh, joey is gonna be right back. right back!  Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So, you're old and small.  
Q:   oh, mine! mine! mine!  okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting. 
A:  okay, hold on.  okay.  
Q:  gas? wow! intense. 
A:   if this is the way all the gellers flirt, we don't have a problem. 
Q:  a lot of other gas smells 
A:  oh the humanity. 
Q:   was i talking to her about gas? 
A:  more so than anything else. 
Q:   hey! is the show still on? 
A:  almost over man. 
Q:   look! oh!  is that the Pope?!  
A:  why am i looking? 
Q:  that's right! 
A:  you couldn't have at least changed your shirt. 
Q:  joey, bravo!   
A:   ground control to major tom! commencing countdown engines on!  
Q:  oh, then no.  
A:   hey! 
Q:  hi! 
A:  you ready? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  you look amazing. i'm the luckiest man in the world. 
Q:  ohh, you're about to get a little luckier. 
A:  let me see the earrings. 
Q:  oh, honey, the earrings 
A:   they look great! does your boyfriend have the best taste or what? 
Q:  my boyfriend really does have good taste!  
A:   thanks for picking out the earrings man. 
Q:  oh, yeah, good idea.  
A:  hey man, what's up? 
Q:  okay! 
A:  yeah, yeah! me too!

A:  tonight? you-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime. Opening Credits 
Q:   that was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy. 
A:  it is starting to get dark out there. 
Q:  yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative. 
A:   okay.  but it is officially nighttime.  
Q:   yeah okay.  even though my tax dollars paid for this car. 
A:  your tax dollars? 
Q:  yeah, okay.  
A:   wow! that sandwich really does smell good. 
Q:  did i say you could smell it?! 
A:  i can't smell your sandwich? 
Q:  half the taste is in the smell! you-you're sucking up all the tastiness! 
A:  okay, i'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich? 
Q:  okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had. 
A:  okay. 
Q:  are you thinking about monica? 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  this witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home. 
A:  sur-surprise him? we're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we? 
Q:  hey, i'm more cop than you two! 
A:  how do you figure that? 
Q:  hello! i'm in the front seat, okay? i'm gary's partner! 
A:  y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. it, it sounds gay. 
Q:  sorry! sorry! oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!   
A:  look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors. 
Q:  the ride along, they're all waiting outside of the witness's house and still in the car in the same places as before.] 
A:  okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? i mean nothing bad can go down! 
Q:  oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off. 
A:   oh, hurry up. i want to sign that. 
Q:  is everything okay? 
A:  what's going on? 
Q:  uh-huh. thank joey! 
A:  uh, hello!! 
Q:  my god, joey! 
A:   it was a car backfire! 
Q:  hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you. 
A:  who jumps at loud noises! 
Q:  wow! i could've died tonight. 
A:  yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.  
Q:  i do have a newfound respect for life. 
A:   oh my god!  
Q:  dude! how come you took off? 
A:  oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever 
Q:  is something wrong? 
A:  no. no i'm just tired. y'know, from-from the walk. 
Q:  okay. 
A:  you dove in front of ross! ross! 
Q:  that's what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross! 
A:  i do not hate ross! 
Q:  of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up! you want Ross out of the picture. 
A:  what picture? 
Q:  i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing! 
A:  look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me! 
Q:  ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! I knew you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us! 
A:  when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line. 
Q:  well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich. 
A:  from a bullet! 
Q:  i know it doesn't make much sense 
A:  much sense?! 
Q:  look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it! 
A:  so you risked your life, for a sandwich! 
Q:  i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world! 
A:  so you didn't uh, choose ross before me. 
Q:  no! i would never do that! you-you're like my brother! 
A:  really?! 
Q:  yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here. 
A:  thanks.  
Q:  how good is that? 
A:   oh-oi-ho, yeah! 
Q:  see? 
A:  hm-hmm.  
Q:  oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?! 
A:  i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me. 
Q:  man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys. 
A:  before or after you were shot by your own troops? 
Q:  i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us. 
A:  yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches. 
Q:  i'm fine, thanks. 
A:   yeah, see, i can't pull of baby-doll can i? 
Q:  no. i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. i'm gonna get some tea. 
A:  okay.  
Q:  i can't believe this! 
A:   right, because it's fast. because, it's so fast. it's fast! 
Q:  relax! it's phoebe! not you! 
A:  oh! good for you pheebs, way to go!  
Q:  no, i like him a lot but i don't think i'm ready for this! 
A:  so, what are you gonna do? 
Q:  i don't know. i'll just handle iti'll ask you to talk to him! 
A:  me?! why me? 
Q:  because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a man! 
A:  i'll try, but i'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? because i'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be. 
Q:  that is so sweet!  
A:   still terrified, i'll take care of it. No problem.  Opening Credits 
Q:  the 5th precinct, gary's precinct, chandler has come to talk to him about commitment. And as he's walking through the door he notices a couple of "Ladies of the night" sitting there. ] 
A:  hey ladies! what are you in here for?  
Q:  hey chandler, what are you doing here? 
A:  gary, i'm here to report a crime. 
Q:  yeah? 
A:  it is a crime that you and i don't spend more time together. 
Q:   what's up? 
A:  well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me. 
Q:  sure. okay. 
A:  uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together! 
Q:  yeah, i-i considered that. i just know it would make me happy. 
A:  you mean scared. 
Q:  no, i mean happy. 
A:  scared? happy? 
Q:  chandler, what-what are you doing? 
A:  i am trying to open your eyes, my man! don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there! 
Q:  i know! i can't wait! 
A:  were you're parents happy, or something? 
Q:  listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I justI wanna be around her as much as I can. 
A:  wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary. 
Q:  so you know what i'm talking about, right? 
A:  yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica! 
Q:  no, it's too soon for you guys. 
A:   yeah, you're right about that. 
Q:  central perk, phoebe is drinking coffee as chandler enters.] 
A:  hi! 
Q:  hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing? 
A:  yes i did, and i think you should do it. 
Q:  what?! 
A:  he's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady. 
Q:  you are useless! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God! 
A:  im sorry.  if you ask me, i'd move in with him. 
Q:  hey chandler. 
A:  hey gar! 
Q:   monica! stop throwing it so hard! we're on the same team!

A:  it's throwing and catching! 
Q:  all right.  
A:  oh! oh! that's so hard.   
Q:  i tried! they won't take her back. 
A:  maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-christ. 
Q:  oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't-don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.

Q:  uh no, not really. it's an independent film y'know? so we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room. 
A:  i see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot? 
Q:  oh yeah! for every dollar shutter speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.

Q:  that game should not be played without my supervision. 
A:  well, i don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? all i said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge. 
Q:  what's in the bag?

A:  y'know, he won't even talk to me. how am i going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?

A:  do we have to? 
Q:  no. 
A:  okay this is great, but joey said he didn't want any of us out there. 
Q:  oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!

Q:  oh that's okay. dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back. 
A:  ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever! 
Q:   oh good! all right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing. 
A:  what-what richard thing? 
Q:  oh no.  
A:  what richard thing? 
Q:  okay, i umm, i ran into richard yesterday and he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary. 
A:   i'm not mad. 
Q:  really?! 
A:  oh yeah! yeah, so you-you bumped into richard! you grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.

Q:  noo! but that would've been so cool! 
A:  no! her boyfriend richard!

Q:  a little white chapel, chandler and monica are entering.] 
A:  hello! one marriage please! 
Q:  all right.  
A:   dum! dum-dum-dum! dum! dum! dum! dum-dum-dum! 
Q:  what are you doing? 
A:  oh, that's the wedding march. does, does that freak you out? 
Q:  no, only because that's the graduation song.  
A:  okay!  this is it!  we're gonna get married! 
Q:  whoa! 
A:  oh my god! 
Q:  okay! okay! okay!   
A:  oh my god!! is everybody getting married?!!  
Q:   hey! dont you give me any of yourhey!  
A:  hey! 
Q:  ross and rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isnt that why you guys are here? 
A:  yes! well that-yes. 
Q:  well! what happened?! did we miss it? 
A:  we actually missed it. 
Q:  whats the big deal, yknow? its not like its a real marriage. 
A:  what?! 
Q:  all right. although i dont think we need one, i never stopped loving you.  
A:  hi! 
Q:  hey. 
A:  so, has anyone talked to dr. and mrs. geller yet? 
Q:  where is the waitress?! im starving! 
A:  its a buffet man. 
Q:  oh, heres where i win all my money back!  
A:  listen, i gotta talk to you. 
Q:  sure! whats up?  
A:  monica and i almost got married last night. 
Q:  oh my god! thats huge!  wait a minute, why come i wasnt invited? And who was going to be your best man? Dont say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross." 
A:  look, i just dont think monica and i are ready to get married yet! Yknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Yknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her? 
Q:  oh! tell her shes not marriage material. 
A:  what?! 
Q:  good! good! i was just testing you. 
A:   hi. 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey!  
Q:  what? 
A:  are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? or 
Q:   who got married?!  
A:   you did. 
Q:  well, i guess we just find a divorce lawyer?  
A:  well, i think, i think, ross already has one. now, this ones free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free. 
Q:  so, what do you think we should do? 
A:  i dont know. but i-i-i know i love you! 
Q:  i know i love you!  
A:  so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you. 
Q:  thats a good question. look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you! 
A:  yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then theres a definite sign that we should get married. 
Q:  all right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we dont get married. 
A:  sounds great. 
Q:  ready? 
A:  ready! 
Q:   come on eight. 
A:   yes, yes eight.  
Q:  wow! i cant believe i actually rolled an eight. 
A:  that was so unlikely. well, lets get married! i guess. 
Q:  wait a minute. that wasnt a hard eight! last night i rolled a hard eight. 
A:  thats right! it was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! damnit! 
Q:  i wanted it so bad!  wanna go pack? 
A:  yeah.  were doing the right thing, right? 
Q:  that kid really kicked me hard on the plane. 
A:  well you did pull his hair. 
Q:  he took my snack! 
A:  im not getting into this again! 
Q:  okay! oh god, yknow what? its really bad. 
A:   well, i told you not to walk. here.  there. okay.  
Q:  this doesnt mean anything, does it? 
A:  no! 
Q:  all right. okay chandler, enjoy your handful.  
A:  all right, should we just, should we just get married? yknow? i mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it. 
Q:  im sick of the signs! its too fast, im happy the way things are! 
A:  me too! 
Q:  i dont want things to change! do you? 
A:  no! 
Q:  all right then, then nothing changes! everything is great! everything stays the same! And you go unpack because its been three days and its driving me insane! 
A:  jeez, relax! its not like were mar-ah-ah!!  
Q:  then all your stuff would be here. 
A:  well, what if all my stuff was here? 
Q:  then youd be going back and forth all the time, i mean it doesnt make any sense. 
A:  okay. what if we lived together and you understand what im saying? 
Q:  live together? there have been no signs for that. 
A:  me asking is kind of a sign. 
Q:  yes!!!!!!!! 
A:  okay!!!!!  
Q:  yes! okay! okay! wait-wait-wait! 
A:  okay. 
Q:  heres your key  
A:  oh thanks.

A:  the door hasnt been locked in five years, but okay!  Ready?! 
Q:  ready!  
A:  okay, a little problem. the key broke in the lock and i cant get in! 
Q:  wait! oh my god! i cant get out! 
A:  this is not a sign! 
Q:  no, its not a sign! its a very old key! 
A:  its an old key! 
Q:  oh my god its old! 
A:  i love you! 
Q:  i love you! 
A:  are you hugging the door right now.

Q:  im not finished. 
A:  oh.  
Q:  monica and rachel's, chandler and monica are cuddling on the couch.] 
A:  yknow when we move in together, can i get a gumball machine? 
Q:  of course! joey wouldnt let you have one? 
A:  no. when it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict. 
Q:  hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out? 
A:  no, no, i keep trying, yknow? i can get out, "joey, i have too " but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, " go to the bathroom." He may think Im sick. 
Q:  yknow, i really have to tell rachel, but i We just have to get it over with! Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them. Okay? Thats it.

Q:  hey! 
A:  hey. 
Q:  ugh, the worse day! yknow, you think youre making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel. 
A:  hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously. 
Q:  i believe you. so, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky! 
A:  well, i-i still think youre very-very nice and very pretty 
Q:  what? 
A:   all yours babe.  
Q:  and chandler, youre gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel cant be late. 
A:  rach 
Q:  monica and rachel's, chandler and monica are still debating about how to tell Rachel that Chandlers moving in and shes moving out.] 
A:  okay, when are we gonna tell rachel what is actually gonna happen? 
Q:  soon! i-i just couldnt before. you saw how upset joey got! i couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend! 
A:  well, joeys my best friend. 
Q:  im not your best friend? 
A:  you just said Of course youre my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though? 
Q:  all right, all right, at least im prepared. 
A:  okay.  oh yes.  
Q:   hey! 
A:  hey-hey! 
Q:  these arent for you! are you upset? 
A:  i am now! 
Q:   hey roomie! 
A:  okay, bye!  
Q:  god, its gonna so weird like when i come home and youre not here. Yknow? No more Joey and Chans. No more J and Cs. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlers?" "Cant, its not there." 
A:  look, im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff. 
Q:  yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future. 
A:  not once did we do that. 
Q:   hi. 
A:  hey! 
Q:  so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us. 
A:  oh yeah? well, howd she take it? 
Q:  really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didnt cry. she wasnt angry or sad.  
A:  and youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry? 
Q:  hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! its like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channies!! 
A:  okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?! 
Q:  hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? huh? and what about this denise, is she cute? 
A:  pheebs, i dont understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about? 
Q:  yeah, yeah i think im gonna find my own place. 
A:  hey-hey! i thought naked thursdays was just our thing man! Opening Credits 
Q:  hey!  dude, some guy just called for you. 
A:  who was it? 
Q:  okay listen, yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it? 
A:  sure! 
Q:  okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much. 
A:  well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones! 
Q:  no. 
A:  okay so you mean no as in, "gee chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely." 
Q:  oh, im sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no. 
A:  so, thats it? 
Q:  i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques. 
A:  which is why asteroids is perfect! its the oldest game! 
Q:  what do you have against the beautiful guest room? 
A:  i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away! 
Q:  are you mocking me? 
A:  no, im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.  
Q:  hey, whats up? 
A:  nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight. 
Q:  but youre still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today.  
A:   "wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice! 
Q:  monica and rachel's, monica is in the kitchen as chandler enters.] 
A:  hi. 
Q:  hi. 
A:  hi, listen, im sorry about before. i dont need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get girls, and now I can emNow, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women 
Q:  stop it chandler.  im sorry too. 
A:  really? 
Q:  yeah! oh yes! 
A:  ohh. 
Q:  listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together. 
A:  thats a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room. 
Q:  totally!  
A:  we dont have to come up with this now. 
Q:  oh good. 
A:  hey, yknow what? why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room? 
Q:  changes? 
A:  yeah, i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.  
Q:  youre-youre-youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here? 
A:  is that a problem? 
Q:  well, its a set and they should probably stay together. 
A:  oh, thats cool. then ill just bring them both over. 
Q:  see now-now youre taking them away from their home. 
A:  okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! Ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work! 
Q:  yeah-yeah, yknow what? yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thats-thats what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! Im talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnt match! Where is it gonna go?! 
A:  in the game room! 
Q:  look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly! 
A:  all right! thats fine! thats fine! i wont bring over the chairs! I wont bring anything over! I wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandmas place!!  
Q:  whoa!! now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. Okay? 
A:   you can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.  
Q:  oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it. 
A:  why did you take the shower curtain down? 
Q:  well, apparently not, and i cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness! 
A:  well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!  
Q:   okay-okay! two very good points, look ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness? 
A:  well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. 
Q:  love is the best medicine. 
A:  thats laughter. 
Q:  why do you do it? 
A:  i dont know. 
Q:  okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right? 
A:  yeah, i do. 
Q:  thats very funny! 
A:  hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness! 
Q:  okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isnt about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!! 
A:  yeah, i'm not so worried. 
Q:  you still want to move in together right? 
A:  of course! 
Q:  ross didnt scare you? 
A:  scared me out of ever wanting to live with him. 
Q:  come here, i want to show you something! 
A:  okay! , the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.) 
Q:  this is where i thought the barca lounger could go! you see you could see the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen. 
A:  oh thats so sweet! i want to show you something too! 
Q:  okay! 
A:  yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "merge?" 
Q:  uh-hmm. 
A:  yknow? so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thats you and I together! Merge! 
Q:  oh my god! i love that! 
A:  really?! 
Q:  central perk, joey, monica, rachel, and chandler are all there as phoebe enters dejectedly.] 
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  oh, whats the matter? 
Q:  well, you know that psychic i see? 
A:  yeah? 
Q:  well, she told me that im gonna die this week, so im kinda bummed about that. 
A:  what?! 
Q:  i dontshe said yknow that id have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black. 
A:  just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go? 
Q:   hey everyone! 
A:  oh hi! 
Q:  ohh! okay! okay.  "there are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into " 
A:  why dont you open with a joke? 
Q:  open with a joke? its a university, not a comedy club! 
A:  wait a minute, hold the phone! youre not talking about Chuckles University?! 
Q:  i-i-i dont even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it. Yknow what? Im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks. 
A:  thats the way i did it til i was 19. 
Q:  chandler and joey's, joey is playing that string game with the two hands and the weird crossing patterns as Chandler enters with the mail.] 
A:  hey. 
Q:  hey! any good mail? 
A:  yes, you got something from the screen actors guild. 
Q:  ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda . 
A:   "benefits lapsed." 
Q:  hmm thats weird. i dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed. 
A:  okay, its not a check. theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year. 
Q:  let me see that! 
A:  all right. 
Q:   oh, i cant believe this! this sucks! when i had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? And it wouldnt matter. Now I gotta be careful?! 
A:  im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire. 
Q:  all right well, i guess i gotta go get a job. im gonna go see my agent. 
A:  okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street. 
Q:  chandler and joey's, chandler enters to find joey lying in the fetus position on the floor.] 
A:  hey! 
Q:   hey! so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time. 
A:  thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now? 
Q:  what?! 
A:  whats wrong with you? 
Q:  nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious. 
A:  this sounds like a hernia. you have toyou-you go to the doctor! 
Q:  no way! kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  
A:  thats a hernia. 
Q:  central perk, chandler is reading on the couch while joey, still suffering from his hernia, is returning with coffee for them both. After a series of grunts and groans he manages to painfully walk back from the counter, sit down, and slide Chandler his coffee.] 
A:  hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?! 
Q:  dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing. 
A:  i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and lets just get that thing pushed back in. 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey. 
Q:  whats going on? 
A:  oh joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix! 
Q:  silvercup studios, joey has won the part of dying man and is now able to play the role he was injured for. Chandler is helping to carry him in.] 
A:  listen, im really glad you got the part. 
Q:   thank you. 
A:  but are you sure you can do this? 
Q:  yeah! and hey, thanks for coming with me. and thanks again for helping me take a shower.  
A:  now, is that never talking about it again?! 
Q:  cut!!!!!!!!!!   
A:  im sorry! hey-hey joe, why dont you uh, lift up your shirt?  Take a look at this kiddo.  We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras! 
Q:  hey-hey-hey! 
A:  what are you doing? 
Q:  were just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back. 
A:  oh, all right.  End 
Q:  when?! after the birth of our first secret child?!  ross didnt get the annulment; we are still married. 
A:  what? 
Q:  okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. but i just couldnt face another failed marriage. 
A:  okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage? 
Q:  another lie. you have a sickness! 
A:  ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married to anymore of us are ya? Opening Credits 
Q:  theres a lost and found?  my shoe!  
A:  you left a shoe here?! 
Q:  well, i didnt realize until i got home. i wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Yknow what? Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.  
A:  oh good, when he comes back for his keys, ill be sure to give him your shoe. 
Q:  oh my god, what a fun day! that sounds great! 
A:   yeah, all right. 
Q:  okay, well ill bring them by tomorrow morning. okay, and uh, by the way, theyre not actually puppies, theyre Frank and Alices triplets. Okay, see ya!  
A:  whoa-whoa-whoa! what? 
Q:  dont worry about it phoebe, well absolutely do it. 
A:  yeah, im gonna pass. cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies. 
Q:  nope, sound like me. pheebs, its going great. look at chandler with little baby girl Chandler. 
A:  little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.  
Q:  na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. 
A:  see thats where i think that youre wrong. weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense. 
Q:  what do you mean? 
A:  i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around  
Q:  that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping. 
A:  okay, im a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.  
Q:   hey guys! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey babies! oh, im having the best morning. that uh, that porsche Ive got the keys too, still there! 
A:  shocking! since you still have the keys. 
Q:  you should see the treatment i get when im with that car! people are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments. 
A:  what equity investments? 
Q:  oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound. 
A:  you dont even have a car! 
Q:  i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it. 
A:  and? 
Q:  and six others. 
A:  there you are. 
Q:  yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same. 
A:   check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!  
Q:  chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someones eye out! 
A:  he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe! 
Q:  no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up. 
A:  theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass! 
Q:  what?! 
A:  glass, sand, whatever.  
Q:  how are you still single?! 
A:   all right.  i thought about it and maybe youre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy. 
Q:  good. what made you change your mind? 
A:  i swallowed the sonic blaster gun. 
Q:  how did that happen?!! 
A:  well, i was trying to prove that i was right. yknow? and it turns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat.   
Q:   so the porsche guy took his car back. 
A:  but you found the keys to his clothes? 
Q:  of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right? 
A:  that is true. 
Q:  come on! what are you doing?! im in character! would you talk to her!  
A:  ahh, i think it just moved. its really poking me. 
Q:  but no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years. 
A:  i think thats gum. 
Q:  im pretty sure its gun. 
A:  okay, listen this really hurts. lets go. 
Q:  me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.  Okay, Im sorry. I didnt mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.  I broke it. All right. Well, thats just the way that goes.  Okay, good.  Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you cant answer.  Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!  Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh!  Oh, youre a lot mischievous! Well, itll dry.   Okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there!   
A:   hey! 
Q:   how do you feel? 
A:  well, lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. 
Q:  okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed. 
A:  and protected them from a tornado?  
Q:  but my apartment! 
A:  was the setting of phoebes triumph. 
Q:  but the mess! 
A:  is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. 
Q:  youre right, youre right i shouldnt freak out. Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?! 
A:   phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! 
Q:  right! and when is that due? 
A:  first of the month. 
Q:  and thats every month? 
A:  no, just the months you actually want to live here. 
Q:  ahhh. 
A:  okay, here is the phone bill.  
Q:   oh my god!! 
A:  thats our phone number. now look, i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont I justwhy dont I just cover you for a while? 
Q:  no-no! no way! joey tribbiani does not take charity anymore. 
A:  its not charity, joe 
Q:  no! forget it! okayi mean thanks, but im done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whats next? Come on. 
A:  okay uh, heres the electric bill.  
Q:  this is how much we pay for electric?!!! 
A:  uh, yeah.  
Q:  so is joey going to have to give up the apartment? 
A:  no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it. 
Q:  well, how much do you think he needs? 
A:  i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wont hurt his pride. 
Q:  why dont you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want. 
A:  well that would help the pride thing. 
Q:   hey! 
A:  hey! wow! you look great! wanna move in with me tomorrow? 
Q:   okay. 
A:  okay!  so, what do you girls have planned for tonight? 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey! so you guys have anything planned for the big last night? 
A:  well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing. 
Q:   okay! the movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, were gonna start with 
A:  oh nope, i-i have plans with joey. 
Q:  i thought you said you were going to do nothing. 
A:  yes, but for the last time. 
Q:  its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he? 
A:  hes at a dinner party. 
Q:  here it is! our last pizzas together as roommates. 
A:  oh, i wish id know you were going to do that, i ordered chinese. 
Q:  oh thats okay. hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!  
A:  say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money? 
Q:  what, are you crazy? you havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money. 
A:  yes it would. what do you say to $50? 
Q:  okay, youre on. 
A:  okay, lets play! the big game, italy vs. china, apparently.  
Q:   yes! i win again! ha-ha! thats like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a loooot of electricity!  Whoo-ho-ho!  I gotta buy some food. 
A:  okay, give me a chance to win my money back. okay? sudden death, one goal, $1,000. 
Q:  you serious? 
A:  oh yes! 
Q:  okay, get ready to owe me! 
A:  okay. 
Q:  okay, here we go. ready?  
A:  no! no! no! noone can beat me.  
Q:  chandler and joey's, joey is examining the broken foosball table as chandler enters from his room.] 
A:  still broken? 
Q:  this sucks man! the last night youre here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500. 
A:  well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?  
Q:  nah, not my game. 
A:  okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? we could play a new game. A new game, its fun. 
Q:  well, whats it called? 
A:  cups. 
Q:  i dont know how to play cups. 
A:  ill teach ya! come on, come on, its really easy and really, really fun. 
Q:  all right. 
A:  okay, here you go.  i have two queens, what do you have? 
Q:  a two and a five. 
A:  ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars! 
Q:  really?! 
A:  oh yeah! okay, lets play again.  What do you got? 
Q:  a four and a nine. 
A:  youre kidding right? 
Q:  no. why? 
A:  well thats a full cup!  
Q:  chandler and joey's, theyre still playing cups.] 
A:  you win. 
Q:  well, what did you have? 
A:  it doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? 
Q:  uh,  wow, 700. 
A:  not 700 exactly? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  double it!  
Q:  what? 
A:  well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. 
Q:  really? 
A:  hey, i didnt make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!  
Q:  hey! 
A:  whats wrong? 
Q:  ross and i were helping the girls pack, took a little break, i lost $1,500 to him in Cups! 
A:  wh-how did you lose at cups?! 
Q:  the same way you lost. i started out with a king and a queen, bamn! ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnt even get half a cup! Nothin!! 
A:  oh man!! 
Q:  and he never played before either! yknow what i think? i think beginners luck, very important in Cups. 
A:  all right, lets play one more hand! one more! 
Q:  no, no, no more! i cannot lose another dime! im serious this time! In-in fact, look, theres aI wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yknow, thank you for being such a great roommate. 
A:  i cant take the big white dog! you love it! 
Q:  its him, not it! 
A:  no, but waitwhat if i bought it from you, yknow? and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500? 
Q:  wait a second, i see what youre trying to do here! you-youre trying to give me money again! 
A:  when did i try to give you money? 
Q:  over there!  before, with the bills! you tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! 
A:  im just trying to help you out! okay? i wanna make sure that youre okay. 
Q:  bye.  
A:   hey. 
Q:  she really left. 
A:  i know.  
Q:  thank you. 
A:  no problem roomie.  
Q:  can i ask you a question? 
A:  sure! 
Q:  rosss apartment, chandler is trying to get joeys money back from Ross.] 
A:  i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money. 
Q:  and now you want that money back. 
A:  exactly. 
Q:  chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?  
A:  its not a real game! i made it up! 
Q:  im sorry you lost your money, but i won it fair and square. 
A:  at a fake game!! 
Q:  now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, id be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups. 
A:  okay! now i assume the saucer card came up when you played last. 
Q:  no. 
A:  hmm, lets see if it comes up this time.  End 
Q:  so, i just finished this fascinating book. by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine. 
A:   and i just realized i can sleep with my eyes open.  
Q:   honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor! 
A:  i didn't nail the boxes to the floor. 
Q:  oh, so you can move them! 
A:  yes, and while i'm doing that, ross has a great computer story for you.  
Q:  i didn't know that! well, what a pretty last name! 
A:  so, uh, wh-where ya from? 
Q:  thank you for bringing her into our lives. 
A:  unbelievable 
Q:  oh, so you like her too chandler? 
A:  hey, look at all the boxes! 
Q:  yeah, yeah man don't do it. i mean if you date her, then-then-then i can't date her. 
A:  all right, think about it. now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket? 
Q:  oh god, yeah. 
A:  now imagine you live at the supermarket. 
Q:   okay! 
A:  no-no 
Q:  monica and chandlers new apartment, chandler is putting something away under the sink.] 
A:  ok, i'm officially unpacked. thanks for helping me man.  Joe?  Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.  
Q:   i gotcha!! 
A:   oh my god! you-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack. 
Q:  boy, it was so hard not to laugh, i tell ya. hey, hey, the place looks great! 
A:  yeah, not bad right? you know what, monicas gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me? 
Q:   i don't! no, i wanna live with the super-hot australian dancer. 
A:  yeah, now how's that going though? are you okay with the not-flirting thing? 
Q:   wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. so, Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin? 
A:  what does it look like i'm doing? i am cleaning! 
Q:  did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff? 
A:  authorization? i don't need that. i'm gonna put everything back. 
Q:  put it back exactly where you found it? 
A:  yes i'm gonna put it back  exactly where i found it. 
Q:  kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping. 
A:  she's not gonna care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place. 
Q:  whoa, hello, did you just meet monica? 
A:  she is gonna recognize that i did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it. 
Q:  hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me. 
A:  i see, i see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out. 
Q:  look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you. 
A:  no, she's not okay? and i'll prove it to you. i'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh. 
Q:   hi! 
A:  hey mon, how's it going? 
Q:  terrible. if-if i want something done right, i have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight. 
A:  oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad. 
Q:  it's worse. the only thing that's getting me through is knowing that i'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early. 
A:  no! no-no-no-no-no-no. it sounds like they really need you down there. 
Q:   well, are you just hanging out with ross? 
A:  it's, all good! okay bye-bye mon!  she's-she's gonna kill me. 
Q:  monica and chandlers, continued from earlier.] 
A:  we should start with the big stuff. yknow? that'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it.  
Q:  yeah that-that, doesn't look right. 
A:  what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table. 
Q:  whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet. 
A:  ok well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch. 
Q:  whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area. 
A:  yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!! 
Q:  look, we do not repel women ok? that is completely untrue. 
A:  oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine? 
Q:  yeah, well what about you? you weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" 
A:  yeah, monica doesn't like that either, maybe i should stop doing that. 
Q:  oh y'know what, girls don't like it when i start talking about science. 
A:  that's not specific to girls. 
Q:  uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar. 
A:  and they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny. 
Q:  they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you. 
A:  man, i'm so lucky i have monica. 
Q:  monica and chandlers, chandler has the tape measure out and is busy lining up the lamp on the kitchen counter, Ross is supervising the whole operation.] 
A:  okay, is this lamp in the same place? 
Q:  who cares? i repel women.  
A:   no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! you can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked. 
Q:   what?! 
A:   i couldn't say that i was naked because she's allowed too see me naked. 
Q:  is it the same thing that chandler had? 
A:  look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later. 
Q:  okay, listen, there's still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye! 
A:  bye! thank god 
Q:  dude, what'd you have? 
A:  look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we gotta get everything back into its original place. 
Q:   the photo album! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures. 
A:  that's perfect! that's brilliant!  
Q:  is it okay for me to come in now? 
A:  uh-huh 
Q:  bye!  
A:  no, i don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.  
Q:  well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets. 
A:  okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
Q:  it's okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something? 
A:  do you want me to be afraid of you? 
Q:  of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that. 
A:  really? 
Q:  of course! 
A:  oh well you're the best. you come here to me. 
Q:  yeah, i gotta go. 
A:  ba dum bumb cheshhh! End 
Q:  sure, neighbor come on in. 
A:  so, is janine around? 
Q:  uh, no, shes at dance class. 
A:  can i check out what she did to my room? 
Q:  yeah, but, hey look, dont go through her stuff. she gets really mad. 
A:   oh my God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous.  Its spreading already. 
Q:   it is??? 
A:   yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch? 
Q:  no. 
A:   is that your tiny little box, thats too small to put anything in? 
Q:  no. 
A:  no! ok, this is not good. you are a guy. ok? this is a guys place. if you let this go, youre going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff. 
Q:   all right, youre right. ill talk to her. 
A:  yes talk to her. be a man. 
Q:  im a man. 
A:  defend yourself. 
Q:  chandler come on. we have to hem the new dust ruffle. 
A:  be right there sweetums.  a totally different situation. Opening Credits 
Q:  hey guys. 
A:  hey, how was your breakfast with hillary? 
Q:  it was okay. shes still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend. 
A:  ohh, yeah. 
Q:  but, pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where i actually work. but, just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much. 
A:  thats weird. i dont think my boss likes me either. 
Q:  or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 1130 on a Wednesday.  
A:  yeah lets head off to work. 
Q:  whats up?  
A:  you know Oh My God. 
Q:  i whitened them.

A:  what??? 
Q:  yeah i know. she ran into him at my office and they just made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip shed heard all year. 
A:  i am proud of all my friends today. 
Q:  my god, rachel, i cant believe phoebe made out with ralph lauren. Ohh, Im so jealous.  
A:  hi, im chandler. your live-in boy

A:  yes, god forbid we throw out old underwear. you-you know what? im going to go over to Joeys. 
Q:  wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer. 
A:  yes, but i feel like ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple. 
Q:  you know what? this has been kind of a girlie day. youre right, Im sorry. 
A:  nah, nah, its okay. i feel like i need to be in guy place. you know, do kind of like a man thing. 
Q:  yeah. go over to joeys. go over to joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall. 
A:  you know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall? 
Q:  hey chandler. come on in. were knitting pot holders. 
A:  no thanks, josephine. 
Q:  rosss apartment, chandler enters. ross is putting on makeup.] 
A:  hey ross, i was wondering if Oh my God!! Where are all the men??? 
Q:  oh my god, joey, that is such a great tip. 
A:  monica, could you excuse us for a second? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers. 
Q:  ohh, i love birds.  
A:  what is the matter with you ?!? 
Q:  what? 
A:  youre arranging flowers!  you got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!! 
Q:  hey. hey look i am still joey, okay. flowers theyre just, you know, theyre nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby. 
A:  youre turning into a women. 
Q:  no im not. why would you say that? thats just mean. 
A:  now ive upset you? what did i say? 
Q:   i miss rachel.  no, my parents. 
A:  oh! thats great, they havent seen the place since i moved in!  
Q:  yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.  
A:   why cant i tell them that we live together? 
Q:  because they dont know were dating.  Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?  
A:  why havent you told them?! 
Q:  um, well, i was going to, i-i-i really was. but um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didnt. 
A:  why havent you told them?! wouldnt they be happy?! 
Q:   so! dinner in the kitchen around four! Ill see you then.  
A:  why wouldnt they be happy? 
Q:  well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. im sorry. 
A:  what? what? why?! 
Q:  maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch. 
A:  is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me? 
Q:  look, i know that i shouldve told them. i know i shouldnt care what they think. Im sorry. 
A:  yknow, itll be okay. itll be okay. because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em. 
Q:  you really think thatll work? 
A:  hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, didnt i? 
Q:  joey and janines, joey and ross are playing sony playstation. Chandler enters.] 
A:  hey!  oh, good, ross! youre parents like me, right?  
Q:   yes, of course they like you! 
A:  well monica just told me that they dont. 
Q:   yeah, they dont like you. 
A:   do you know why? 
Q:  i dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. or maybe its cause you uh- 
A:   well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess!  
Q:  maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin up, eh? 
A:  maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment. 
Q:  well maybe i love ya. 
A:  .  
Q:  hey. 
A:  hey.  
Q:   oh yes of course, hello chandler. 
A:  mr. and mrs. geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!  
Q:  yknow dad, chandler is one of rosss very best friends! 
A:  yeah, ross sure is a great guy, yknow ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father. 
Q:  i always thought that too. tell me, what does your father do?  
A:   hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show.  
Q:  oh, thank you chandler! i just bought it. 
A:  oh, yes. well its very beautiful. its cream-colored and tight  I dont mean tight, I mean its not too tight, not that I was looking at- 
Q:   i think hes stoned again. 
A:   what? 
Q:  okay, i think i might know why my parents dont like you. 
A:  you do? why? 
Q:  okay, remember, we were young. hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window. 
A:  what?! why did you do that? 
Q:  i dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, Im Im sorry. I-I didnt think it would matter. 
A:  how could it not matter?! 
Q:  how was i supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister? 
A:  what about all that friends forever stuff? 
Q:  mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned! 
A:  your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me! 
Q:  ross, i cant believe youd do that! 
A:  the reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this? 
Q:  oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay? 
A:  yeah, im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.  
Q:   mmm. 
A:   yeah, this is so good, that Im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.  
Q:  ...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?  
A:   yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.  
Q:  chandler! youve been rosss best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.  And now youve taken on Monica as well. Well, I dont know what to say. Youre a wonderful human being.  
A:  thank you! 
Q:  no! thank you!  monica, and ross! i dont know what Im gonna do about the two of you! 
A:   ill talk to them! Closing Credits

A:  why? 
Q:  chandler, arent you worried about what to get monica for Christmas? 
A:  no, i have a great idea for a present for her. 
Q:  chandler, thats not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gotten her one great present? I mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why? 
A:  if i help, we can find em faster! 
Q:  we are so gonna find them this year. 
A:  yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  you dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything? 
Q:  no, we never do that

Q:  or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? no! Didnt think so! Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are! 
A:  oh, the duck seems to think that monica got me garbage! hmm, i wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?

Q:  whatever linus, im opening mine. 
A:  nobody is opening anything ok? look, i dont know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monicas face when I give her my present, and Im sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?

A:  a pharmacist.  
Q:  i hate pottery barn too. they kicked me out of there just because i sat on a bed! 
A:  you took off your pants and climbed under the sheets! 
Q:  hey! i made that for her! 
A:  you made pottery? 
Q:  okay fine! ill-ill just tell her its an antique apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs. 
A:  ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore 
Q:  the hallway between the apartments, joey, janine, chandler, and monica are returning from a double date. Chandler is telling a joke.]

Q:   what?!!  what? 
A:  so she was just pretending to have a good time last night? she was lying to our faces?! 
Q:  ugh, i can not believe this! i mean, who is she to judge us? we could not have been nicer to her! 
A:  and i am not blah, i am a hoot! 
Q:  i know! i know! come on, please-please you guys, dont-dont be mad. Im sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Yknow? And it was our first date! Plus, shes really sick! 
A:  no, you shno you said you made that up!!

A:  oh yeah! 
Q:   i knew it!! yknow, youre not so quiet yourself, missy! 
A:  and im blah? listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment." 
Q:  all right! all right! enough! enough! enough!! enough!  You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!

A:  i made that joke up. 
Q:  uh, oh-oh, no you didnt. i did. 
A:  yes, i did. i told it to dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke hed ever heard. 
Q:  im sorry, i was just reading the joke below it. man, that one is funny.  
A:  monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right? 
Q:  no. 
A:  seriously? 
Q:  look, chandler, its my joke. but, hey, if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit, right? 
A:  yeah, i guess. 
Q:   hey guys. 
A:   hey, joey, playboy printed my joke. 
Q:  no, its my joke, its mine. you can call them, theyll tell you. 
A:  its my joke. 
Q:  joeys apartment, joey is sitting at the counter as chandler enters.] 
A:  dude, you have got to turn on behind the music. the band heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up. 
Q:  lets go watch it at your place. 
A:  nah, monicas watching some cooking show. come on, i dont want to miss when they were skinny. 
Q:  chandler, chandler, yknow what we should do? you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses. 
A:  what? no, i want to watch this. . Did your cable go out? 
Q:  no, thats vh-1. i gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . Its like a lotta noise to me. I dont know 
A:  joey, why is your cable out? 
Q:  i uh, oh! because, uh, i havent really paid the bill 
A:  if you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money? 
Q:  no, chandler. look, forget about it, okay? look, i know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. 
A:  whoa ho. 
Q:  i know! yeah, but, look i can handle it. all right? look, i can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book . 
A:   all right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place? 
Q:  sure. 
A:   paid your phone bill? 
Q:  you forget how many great songs heart had. 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard. 
A:  so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it. 
Q:  what, you didnt get it? the doctor is a monkey.  
A:  and monkeys cant write out prescriptions.  
Q:  your joke? well, i think the hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars. 
A:  so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money. 
Q:  well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer. 
A:  well, she is going to know that you stole the joke. 
Q:  oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there? 
A:  yeah! 
Q:  well, im not going to go now anyway . 
A:  okay .  
Q:   she picked rachel. i mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel. 
A:   he took my joke, he took it. 
Q:  its wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel. 
A:  you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? Im going to get a joke journal. Yknow? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes. 
Q:  thats a good idea. 
A:  yeah! 
Q:  do you know whats a bad idea? 
A:  picking rachel. 
Q:  thats right.  did you hear something? 
A:  maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts. 
Q:  its kind of embarrassing, yknow. i mean, i was an actor and now Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction. 
A:  so is your apron. youre wearing it like a cape. 
Q:  see, now its weird again. 
A:  i think its great that you work here. youre going to make 
Q:  its my joke. 
A:  its my joke. 
Q:  yknow, i dont think were going to settle this. 
A:  lets have monica decide. 
Q:  yeah! 
A:  yeah! 
Q:  hey mon. 
A:  mon, get out here! 
Q:  monica!  
A:  okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is. 
Q:  why do i have to decide? 
A:  because youre the only one that can be fair. 
Q:  yeah, but im your brother. were family. thats the most important thing in the world. 
A:   dont try to sway her.   im your only chance to have a baby. Okay, lets go. 
Q:  okay, chandler, you go first. 
A:  okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve. 
Q:  oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas? 
A:  can i finish my story?! 
Q:  continue. 
A:  so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steves doctors name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Doctor Monkey? And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.  
Q:  are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. Im Doctor Monkey! 
A:  im not arguing with that. 
Q:  its your joke. 
A:  is not. 
Q:  hi, chandler. there you are. 
A:  hi, oh hi. 
Q:  hey, its phoebe and rachel. um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?  
A:   monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.  Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit. 
Q:  wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler. 
A:   im out of words. should i just say the whole thing again? 
Q:  look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler! 
A:   youre a little high maintenance. 
Q:  ahhh! you are on my list. 
A:  im sorry. youre not easy-going, but youre passionate, and thats good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that Im pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thats good too. So, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because I like maintaining you. 
Q:    i didnt even tell him to say that. . All right youre off my list. 
A:   im off the list.  
Q:   yknow, suddenly i find you very attractive.  
A:  hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go? 
Q:  yeah, well, i kinda thought.   
A:  hey. 
Q:  im not answering that. 
A:  joey!  no way. im not answering that. End 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey, what are you doing here? shouldnt you be at work? 
Q:  ohh! 
A:  im so sorry youre sick. 
Q:   i have not been sick in over three years!  
A:  im gonna grab you some tissue. 
Q:  im fine-d. im fine-d! yknow, its a really hard word to say.  
A:  yes?  
Q:  oh my god, rachel!  
A:  oh my god, introduce us! 
Q:  yeah but it wasnt for me, it was for a friend. 
A:  boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!  
Q:  okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? lets do something crazy! 
A:  i know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids.  
Q:  okay, ill rest. but yknow if im going to bed, then youre coming with me. 
A:  that would be impossible to resist if you werent all drippy here.  
Q:   are you saying that you dont wanna get with this?  
A:  yeah, i dont you should say that even when youre healthy.

A:  yeah, im gonna stick with the ring.  Oh, this ones nice!  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one? 
Q:  can i help you? 
A:  uh-uh, yes. i would like to see that ring please. 
Q:  this ring is from the 1920s, its a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side. 
A:  sir, can i ask you to umm, could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you? 
Q:  okay.  will you marry me? 
A:   oh my god thats it, thats the ring! how much is it?

A:  oh, i cant go. 
Q:  chandler, i found the perfect ring.  
A:  oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but im gonna go with the one I picked first. 
Q:  oh my god chandler, the one you picked is gone. its over! 
A:  what? 
Q:  some guy bought it. im sorry. i tired to stop it but they  put me in jail! 
A:  they put you in jail? 
Q:  the little jail between the doors! 
A:  phoebe, i asked you to guard the ring! 
Q:  i know, im sorry! but yknow, this ring is better! monica never even saw the other ring. 
A:  yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring i got goose bumps. 
Q:  maybe it was the guy. 
A:  it was the ring! 
Q:   hey. 
A:  i cant believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring! 
Q:  its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! its a beautiful ring! 
A:  no, its not! when i looked at the other ring i could see Monicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing Im gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect. 
Q:  okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something. 
A:  i cant do that. 
Q:  there he is!  
A:  okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger. 
Q:  wow! youre good! after this, we should solve crimes. 
A:  yeah! okay, go, go, go get him. 
Q:   here he is. 
A:   hi! hi. okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Im gonna need to have that back.  But, in exchange Im willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.  Ew. 
Q:  it is beautiful, but im gonna use this one. now, if youll excuse me. 
A:  no-no! this is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You dont want to break her heart now do you? 
Q:  youre dying?!  
A:  yeah, shes dying Of a cough apparently. 
Q:  yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. see, if im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity 
A:   okay, thats enough honey! 
Q:  i dont know.  let me see the ring. 
A:  great! okay, here.  
Q:   all right.  
A:  thank you. thank you. thank you!  and you are about to marry a wonderful man!  Hey! Im marrying a dead woman!

A:  what?! im chandler!  Oh, thats Richard! 
Q:   monica! chandler! 
A:  hey-hey, hey!  i dont know why i did that! 
Q:  well, my nose got lonely. 
A:   and uh, you dont have a mustache which is good.  Im Chandler; I make jokes when Im uncomfortable. 
Q:  hi, im lisa. 
A:  hi. 
Q:  oh, im sorry.  lisa,  monica, Chandler. We used to date. 
A:  richard! no one supposed to know about us!  See I, did it again. 
Q:  chandler, wh-why dont we sit down? 
A:  yeah, ill sit down.  
Q:  oh. good to see you guys. 
A:  yes.  
Q:  for further reading on the above story, please check out the one where joey moves out.} 
A:  i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.  
Q:  ohh. 
A:  what?!  
Q:  oh my god, you guys!!  
A:   before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner! 
Q:  who? 
A:  richard! 
Q:  what?  a-ohh!  ohh. oh thats right thats right. Thats Richards favorite place too. 
A:  oh you knew that. good! 
Q:  shes leaving for three months. 
A:  for camp! 
Q:  ive got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part. 
A:  hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if youre not careful you may not get married at all this year! 
Q:   okay.  
A:   what did you guys just do?! 
Q:  what happened? 
A:  richard was there so i couldnt do it! 
Q:  what?! noooo  
A:  im gonna do it tomorrow yknow, and-and surprise her, but now youve ruined it! 
Q:  we didnt ruin it! 
A:  who walks into a room and asks to see a persons hands?! 
Q:  good one! yeah. 
A:  this is terrible. what am i going to do? 
Q:  look, she only suspects something okay? she doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track. 
A:  thats right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind. 
Q:  yeah! yeah! convince her that-that youre scared of commitment! Convince her that youre a little coward! 
A:  i can do that, ive had 30 years of practice. 
Q:  central perk, chandler is looking out the window and joey is sitting on the couch.] 
A:  okay, okay, here she comes!  how do i look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married? 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  what are you up too? 
A:  oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. 
Q:  well thats a little crazy. although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet. 
A:  yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? 
Q:  why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world! 
A:  eh 
Q:  so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you? 
A:  sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs dont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports! 
Q:  yeah, but thats pigs not people! 
A:  if marriage worked, id be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%. 
Q:  wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married? 
A:  well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never. 
Q:  oh my god! then-then-then what are we even doing?! what is this?! 
A:  whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? Why dont you put down your copy of The Rules huh mantrap?! 
Q:  yknow what?! i gotta go! ugh!  
A:   its okay, i got a plan. 
Q:  where the hell have you been?! 
A:  i was making a coconut phone with the professor. 
Q:  richard told monica he wants to marry her! 
A:  what?! 
Q:  yeah! yeah, ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldnt keep flying off! 
A:  myoh my god! 
Q:  i know! they suck!! 
A:  hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! im supposed to do that! 
Q:  i know! 
A:  well what Yknow what Im gonna do? Im gonna go over there; Im gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?! 
Q:  look, chandler i dont think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica! 
A:  youre right. 
Q:  yeah! 
A:  okay.  im gonna get the ring! Im gonna get the ring!  Im gonna go find her and  Im just going to propose! 
Q:  okay. 
A:  okay great. 
Q:  dude-dude-dude! 
A:  what?! 
Q:  chandler. 
A:  where is she? im not scared of you!  
Q:  shes not here and please come in. 
A:   scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica! 
Q:  okay, she was here, but she left. 
A:  well where did she go? 
Q:  well she said she had to think things over. 
A:  oh my god, i cant believe this! yknow, i thought I thought you were a good guy. 
Q:  oh, hey look nothing happened. 
A:  nothing happened? nothing? so you didnt tell my girlfriend that you love her? 
Q:  well all right, one thing happened? 
A:  yknow what? i cant believe this! do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!! 
Q:  well im sorry. 
A:  and what does she have to think about? i love her! 
Q:  well, apparently im willing to offer her things that you are not. 
A:  but i am willing to offer her all those things. this was just a plan, yknow? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, shed be surprised! 
Q:  well if it helps, it worked very well. 
A:  it was working until you showed up, you big tree! i mean, this isnt fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was gonna propose tonight. 
Q:  you were gonna propose?  
A:  yeah i even  got a ring.  did you get a ring? 
Q:  no i dont have a ring!  you go get her chandler.  And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, dont let her go. Trust me. 
A:  yknow richard you are a good guy. 
Q:  dude! 
A:  i cant talk to you now, i gotta find monica! 
Q:  shes gone. 
A:  what? 
Q:  shes gone. she had a bag and she left. 
A:  what are you talking about? 
Q:  she was all crying. she-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think. 
A:  well why didnt you stop her?! why didnt you just tell her it was a plan?! 
Q:  i-i did! i told her everything, chandler! but she wouldnt believe me. 
A:  well where Where did she go? 
Q:  to her parents i think and she said you shouldnt call her. but if I were you I would. 
A:  i cant believe i ruined this. 
Q:  you wanted it to be a surprise.  
A:  oh my god.  
Q:  chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to fall in love with my best my best Theres a reason why girls dont do this! 
A:  okay!  okay! okay! oh god, i thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me? 
Q:  hey, whats going on?

A:  now monica, i know youre upset, but dont forget. there is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris. 
Q:  paris? 
A:  we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la . 
Q:  keep talking. 
A:  then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not just because its romantic, but because I can! 
Q:   bonjour, monsieur. 
A:  okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.  
Q:  yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date. 
A:  pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding! 
Q:  maybe just 10 minutes for you.  
A:  oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i dont care!  
Q:  monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me? 
A:  what a great apology!  and you accept! okay, bye-bye! 
Q:  my sweet sixteen! remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie. 
A:   ahh, third base. 
Q:  uh, rachel, ive been thinking. i dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. Im calling it off. 
A:   why to save your dignity my man. 
Q:   i cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night!! 
A:  well, somebody should.   
Q:  i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Im going to announce that Im pregnant! 
A:  how is that ever going to happen?! 
Q:  look, i am so so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that Im not. Im not even close. And I dont know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thats dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!  
A:   i dont care, she slept with me. 
Q:   well, im going to take off.  congratulations man. 
A:  thanks. 
Q:   "We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. Thats right, Im here all night, and Chandler will never get l " 
A:   hey! heres a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding. 
Q:  oh thank you. 
A:  okay.  
Q:   oww! 
A:  whats the matter honey? 
Q:  okay!  
A:   already?! 
Q:  yeah, we got a lot to do! we gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music 
A:  oh, i got some thoughts on that. 
Q:   okay!  
A:  what in gods name is that?! 
Q:  a jazz trio for cocktails. the bay city rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding. 
A:  well, you couldnt get them anyway. ian doesnt plan anymore and Derrick  And Derrick is a name I shouldnt know. 
Q:   hey mon, do you have another pillow?  Yknow, something a little snugglyer? 
A:  why are you napping over here instead of over at your place? 
Q:  uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up! 
A:  now, do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding? 
Q:  of course you can look at it! yeah, i want your opinion too! 
A:  okay. 
Q:  here you go! what do you think about centerpieces? 
A:  centerpieces! 
Q:  yeah! roses or lilies?  
A:  definitely roses.  well, i just think theyre a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice. 
Q:  oh my god! its like one mind. 
A:  uh-huh! 
Q:  so chandler, youre parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged. 
A:  oh yeah, i should probably call them. 
Q:  i remember when we first got engaged. 
A:  oh, i dont think i ever heard that story. 
Q:   you dont know how that happened?! your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy! 
A:  what a sweet story. 
Q:  well it was chandler! we didnt think hed ever propose! 
A:  clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.  
Q:  i cant believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it? 
A:  i dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood. 
Q:  wait, but theres no money! well this is terrible! you guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center! 
A:  honey, its gonna be okay. 
Q:  no, yknow what? its gonna be okay. i mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.  
A:  look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married. 
Q:  how? i dont have any money. 
A:  well, i have some. 
Q:  how much? 
A:  well, close to  
Q:   ohh, you guys are so made for each other. 
A:  well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding? 
Q:  ah, yeah! 
A:  well, come on, ive been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party. 
Q:  this is the most special day of our lives. 
A:  no, i realize that honey, but im not gonna spend all of the money on one party. 
Q:  honey, umm i-i love you,  but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay?  Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna get married once. 
A:  look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no. 
Q:  you-youre gonna have to put your foot down? 
A:  yes, i am! 
Q:  hey. 
A:  hey. 
Q:  listen umm, ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that. 
A:  ehh. 
Q:  eh, you work for that. 
A:  look, i thought about it too, and im sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding. 
Q:  you do?! 
A:  yeah, im putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do. 
Q:  oh, youre so sweet.  oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff? 
A:  eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. 
Q:  you thought about that? 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  how many kids were we gonna have? 
A:  uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy. 
Q:  what else did you think about? 
A:  well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old. 
Q:   yknow what? i-i dont want a big, fancy wedding. 
A:  sure you do. 
Q:  no, i want everything you just said. i want a marriage. 
A:  you sure? 
Q:  uh-hmm. 
A:  i love you so much. 
Q:  i love you.  hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right. 
A:  oh yeah, totally! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  so, what do you think? 
Q:  what? 
A:  are you kidding? okay, ill give you a hint; ill give you a hint.  
Q:  eyes! no, no. your eyes! no. chandlers eyes! 
A:  i got glasses! 
Q:  well, you-youve always had glasses. 
A:  no i didnt! 
Q:  yes! 
A:  no! 
Q:  sweetie, i think the glasses look great. they make you look really sexy. 
A:  really? 
Q:  yeah! 
A:   you didnt think i used to wear glasses, right? 
Q:  so what do you guys want for an engagement present? 
A:  thats okay pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so you dont have to get us 
Q:  hey, i know i what i want! 
A:  what we want honey. 
Q:  you mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family? 
A:  dying people say the craziest things. 
Q:  okay. im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best chocolate chip cookies. 
A:  our kids are gonna be fat arent they. 
Q:   ahoy! 
A:  hey! hows the boat?! 
Q:  oh, its great! its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.  
A:  well, its good that you finally have a place to do that. 
Q:  central perk, chandler and monica are there. he takes off his glasses and starts chewing on the ear piece.] 
A:  do you know what i was thinkin? 
Q:  what? 
A:  nothing, i just like to go like this.  
Q:   hey chandler, what are you doing tonight? 
A:  uh why, do you have a lecture? 
Q:  no, why? 
A:  then free as a bird. whats up? 
Q:  yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for chancy, i assumed he meant you. 
A:  well, did-did you correct him? 
Q:  he hates to lose. 
A:  oh no problem, maybe ill play with my left hand. 
Q:  youre not a lefty? 
A:  does anybody know me?!  
Q:  oh, we have to get you an engagement present? 
A:  dont worry about it pheebs. 
Q:  okay, here i wish you health and happiness.  
A:  an old cookie? 
Q:  see no-no, i made a batch and i froze it, and this is the only one left. 
A:  we cant accept this. 
Q:  why not? 
A:  cause its gross. 
Q:  yeah! i bet i can do it.  
A:  okay, we owe you a present. 
Q:  well i had a great time! umm, chancy on the other hand 
A:  i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding. He even said I could call him dad. 
Q:  and what did he ask you not to call him? 
A:  daddy. all right look, heres the story.  Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and thats when in happened.  
Q:  oh my god chandler! i cant believe it! 
A:  i know. 
Q:  you gave my father a lap dance! 
A:  why do they put so much steam in there?! 
Q:  cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room. 
A:  why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen? 
Q:  come on, its not that big a deal! 
A:  not that big a deal? there there was touching of things. 
Q:  listen, im sure that dad doesnt care. he probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years! 
A:  i dont want him to tell this story for years. 
Q:  you were trying to eat it!  
A:  if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off! 
Q:  central perk, chandler, ross, and rachel are there.] 
A:   all right, im off to see your dad. 
Q:   yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time. 
A:  look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass.  
Q:  the gym, chandler and mr. geller are heading for the whirlpool room.] 
A:  so you understand, id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. Yknow, Im a little Im a little embarrassed about it. 
Q:  i understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer. 
A:  what did you do when they found out? 
Q:  they never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?  
A:  so i guess we wear swimsuits in here! Ending Credits 
Q:   hello?  hold on please. joey, its your mom.  
A:  its your mommy. its your mommy. 
Q:  it wasnt the best. 
A:  that was one of the worse things ever. and not just on tv. 
Q:  i dont know. i dont know. i cant lie to him again. oh no Ino! Im just gonna press my breasts up against him. 
A:  and say nothing? 
Q:  central perk, chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in and sits in their easy chair.] 
A:  no-no-no-no.  Hey!  
Q:   hey sweetie. 
A:  hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering? 
Q:  i cant tell you. its a secret. 
A:  secret? married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another. 
Q:  awww.  but still no. 
A:  no im serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you. 
Q:  really? okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to ross junior year at Disneyland? 
A:  oh no-no, i cant do that. 
Q:  if you tell me, ill tell you what phoebe said.

Q:  lewis posin! he was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why? 
A:  because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?! 
Q:  no! but because he thought i was to faaaaa .  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie. 
A:  what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago. 
Q:  no, i know. but yknow what? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me. 
A:  okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with! 
Q:  a random apartment building, chandler and monica are knocking on the door of the woman from the beginning.] 
A:   julie hi! chandler bing, i, i guess you remember me. 
Q:  hello skidmark.

A:  you-you-you didnt know that.  well, i guess my work here is done! 
Q:  monica, chandler, and phoebe's, chandler and monica have returned from Julies.] 
A:  as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself. i think that im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do. 
Q:  why dont you just stop doing stupid things? then you wouldnt have to apologize. 
A:  i would really love it if could do both. 
Q:  all right, i I have to ask. 
A:  what? 
Q:  are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again? 
A:  what?! 
Q:  well, you broke up with julie grath! how much weight could she have gained? 
A:  a hundred and forty-five pounds. 
Q:  in one year?! my god what did she eat? her-her family! thats not the point. 
A:  look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15! 
Q:  well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat. 
A:  okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different. 
Q:  how? 
A:  you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back! 
Q:  what if i have babies, okay? i mean im gonna look different. Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are! 
A:  look you have to realize i dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. 
Q:  keep going. 
A:  so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you. 
Q:  even if i shrink down to two inches tall? 
A:  id carry you around in my pocket. 
Q:  i love you.  
A:  skidmarks still got a way with the ladies.

Q:  come on! so she comes to the wedding! i mean it wont be so bad. 
A:  what do you think shes just gonna sit there quietly? you dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? You dont think shes gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?! 
Q:  oh my god, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?! 
A:  yknow what? its gonna be okay. yknow what? Shes probably not gonna even want to come. 
Q:  really? 
A:  no! that was a lie! see how easy that was? 
Q:  so-so you wouldve just lied? 
A:  yes!! 
Q:  would it really have been that easy? 
A:  yes!!! 
Q:  i should just go on to happier things, okay? umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding? 
A:  well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, its going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Were not even sure why were having it. 
Q:  what are we gonna do? 
A:  i say we go with careless whisper.  
Q:  chandler? 
A:   did she see us yet? did she see us? 
Q:  please, its because otherwise i really dont know what i might do. 
A:  arent you just a tinsy bit curious? 
Q:  well just well just let her stay. 
A:  no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever! 
Q:  kinda like your barca lounger. 
A:  is that what youre thinking about right now? 
Q:  hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath. 
A:  janice, im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight. 
Q:  why not? 
A:  honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.  
Q:  he does? 
A:  say again? 
Q:  thats right. thats right. and that is why you cant stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding. 
A:  feelings, such strong feelings. 
Q:   dont sweat it, ive got this section covered. Yeah, in fact Ive got this little baby  to shine in peoples eyeOkay, see you later.  
A:  i just wanted to show monica your book.  End 
Q:   hey everybody! happy thanksgiving! 
A:  no, no, no. no-no-no. 
Q:  what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year? 
A:  no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes. 
Q:  what? that's like insanely easy! 
A:  now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . 
Q:  nobody cares about the dakotas.   
A:  oh, okay, time's up! 
Q:  all right, i got 48. 
A:  oh that's not bad, pheebs? 
Q:  regular celery. 
A:  okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in vegetables, Joey? 
Q:  hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports-team! 
A:  does south oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.  
Q:  done! with time a-to-spare. 
A:  oooh that may be a new world's record  
Q:  you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? 
A:  uh, magellan? you got 46 states.  
Q:  all right, i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna turn on joey's. please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! 
A:  i am only one man!  okay ross, time is up! 
Q:  no, just give me another minute. 
A:  look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. 
Q:  this-this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner. 
A:  okay, but if you can't no dinner! 
Q:  chandler? can you give me a hand?  
A:  sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. 
Q:  rosss apartment is nice! how come we don't hang out here more often? 
A:  i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something. 
Q:  that's my pie! 
A:  which smells delicious! 
Q:  uh-oh! uh-oh! 
A:  what? 
Q:  phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
A:  tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue! 
Q:  ohio!! thank you!  
A:  huh! where is the dog?! 
Q:  there's no dog in here.  
A:  phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! 
Q:  no that's just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room. 
A:  what is it doing here? 
Q:  oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic! 
A:  extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! 
Q:  that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 
A:   really? 
Q:  chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 
A:  well, it still has to go, right? 
Q:  why? 
A:  okay, it's um 
Q:  don't do what? 
A:   i have to! okay? it's time!  Okay, I hate dogs. 
Q:  told ya.  
A:  they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. 
Q:  wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies? 
A:   is there a puppy here? 
Q:  you don't like puppies? 
A:   okay, you are new! 
Q:  it's too cold. 
A:  okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. 
Q:   it hurts my teeth. 
A:  and i don't wanna say this, i don't you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!  
Q:  where's chandler? 
A:   here i am. 
Q:  wash your hands!!! 
A:  how did you know?   
Q:  see, this is exactly what we do not have time for.  
A:   where's monica? 
Q:  um, in phoebe's room. you can't go in there. 
A:  why not?  
Q:  monica's crying. she's very upset about this whole clunkers thing. 
A:  well, i, i should go in there. 
Q:  no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now. 
A:  why not? 
Q:  because you sent away the dog! 
A:  this is ridiculous.  
Q:   okay, i'm in my sweat pants. bring on the food!  What's the matter? 
A:  monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away. 
Q:  so? bring the dog back, you're a hero. 
A:  yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 
Q:  chandler, it's like a big gerbil. 
A:  and that doesn't scare you?  
Q:   hey, is chandler here? 
A:  no, no he went for a walk. 
Q:  hi, honey. 
A:  please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 
Q:   shh, wait and see. maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
A:  okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. Yknow, for you, and  I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.  
Q:   hi! 
A:  clunkers?! oh my god! 
Q:  it's a thanksgiving miracle! 
A:   it is so good to see you! 
Q:  okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something. 
A:  it's up to you.  
Q:  delaware!  delaware! 
A:  all right. 
Q:   i want my turkey now! 
A:  you got it.  You got Nevada twice. 
Q:   i know. 
A:  yeah.  End 
Q:  uh-huh! 
A:  okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.  
Q:  no-no, one daddy, two mommies. all right, its all yours.  
A:  okay. okay. 
Q:  well, we didnt have a lot of money. but the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on. 
A:  that sounds like my first bike.  my dad gave me his old one. 
Q:  monica, chandler, and phoebe's, monica is cooking, joey is eating, and chandler is entering from the bedroom.] 
A:  hey! what are you guys doing? 
Q:  making holiday candy for the neighbors. 
A:  im sorry, who? 
Q:  im gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece. 
A:  but we dont know the neighbors. 
Q:  see? this is exactly why im making this candy. we can learn their names and get to know our neighbors. 
A:  wouldnt it be easier if we just moved? 
Q:   gooood morning!! 
A:  eh, somebodys in a good mood! 
Q:  the basket is totally empty! my god, the neighbors ate all the candy! 
A:  well, either that or uh  
Q:   oh and chandlers about to cry. 
A:   am not! 
Q:   who is that?! 
A:  dont worry, im brave! i am brave! i I am brave!  No-no-no-no!!   Can you tell me who is there please? 
Q:  oh please!  did you hear that? little drops of heaven. 
A:   400 a.m. 
Q:  so, can i get some candy? 
A:  i am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!   He does not know that I am not some of us. 
Q:   mm! seems like i wouldve remembered you! 
A:  mm! night gar!  
Q:  almost cried huh? hear that chandler? almost cried! 
A:  hey, you cry every time somebody talks about titanic! 
Q:  oh hi! 
A:  hey! so are you enjoying the bike? 
Q:  see, this is why i told you never get involved with your assistant! and here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing! 
A:   what happened? im just eating candy. 
Q:  maybe its not as bad as i think. yknow, maybe they didnt take it the way I meant it. 
A:  absolutely! yknow, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker. 
Q:  oh my god! joey! 
A:  what is the matter with you? 
Q:   hey chandler, do we know that lady?

Q:   its unbelievable! i-i cant believe that sign didnt work! 
A:  yknow what would work? 
Q:  hmm? 
A:  stop making candy! 
Q:  but they like it! 
A:  you mean they like you. 
Q:  maybe. 
A:  is that why you became a chef? so that people would like you?

A:   what is going on? 
Q:  yeah lady! give us candy!!

A:  all right everybody! just be quiet! be quiet! be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and Ill bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right? 
Q:   candy lady? 
A:  no not  candy lady. 
Q:   hey, if we know it can we have candy?!! 
A:  all right, yknow what? forget it, all of you forget it! Youve ruined it! Go home! Youve ruined it! Youve ruined it!

Q:  central perk, chandler is getting a cup of coffee and sits down next to Monica.] 
A:  hey, you know what i was thinking? when we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing? 
Q:  no. 
A:  why not? 
Q:   oh, hey, you guys! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  yes, you will be very sad. all right, well i gotta go tell rachel the good news. 
A:  ohh! you guys gonna be living together again? 
Q:  yeah, why not? 
A:  well, she's just so much fun with joey, i just assumed, she'd still be living with him. 
Q:  why do you think, she's having so much fun living with joey? 
A:  no reason, except she told me. 
Q:  really? so she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore? 
A:  no! no, she didn't say that. i-i-i think you should talk to monica now. 
Q:  probably? yeah, i don't like that word.  Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves!  In this world history teaches us nothing!  
A:  bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? 
Q:  michelle's, chandler and monica enter.] 
A:   hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?  
Q:  oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes. 
A:  forty-five minutes? we have tickets to the musicman at 800. 
Q:  i'm sorry. christmas is a very busy time, sir. 
A:  is this because of the burrito thing? 
Q:   you need to give him money. 
A:  give him money? it was a joke! 
Q:  no, to get a table! places like are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off. 
A:  right, calm down, o'mally. i'll slip him some money. 
Q:  you've got to be smooth about it. 
A:  hey, i can be smooth.  Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.  
Q:  of course, sir. 
A:  okay.  
Q:  how did it go? 
A:  had the money in the wrong hand.  
Q:  it's easy! just keep it casual! give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money! 
A:  how do you know so much about this? 
Q:  i don't know. 
A:  richard used to do it, didn't he? 
Q:  we'd be eating our soup right now. 
A:  mustached bastard 
Q:   okay, those people just left, come on! quick! Give him the money and get their table! 
A:   excuse me...  
Q:   good evening.  
A:   ahh-hahaha!  
Q:  here you go. 
A:  thank you gunther, put it there.  Definitely not easier with coins.  Thank you. 
Q:  here.  now i only owe you $49.50. 
A:  hey pheebs! 
Q:  hey!  
A:  if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway? 
Q:  years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees... 
A:   ho, ho, ho! merry christmas! 
Q:  santa!  
A:  hey!  
Q:  what are you doing here, santa? 
A:  well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird turtle-man? 
Q:  i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember? 
A:  what? 
Q:  did you bring me any presents, santa? 
A:  you bet i did, ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho! 
Q:   what are you doing? 
A:  you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work! 
Q:  thank you, but, but you gotta leave. 
A:  why? 
Q:  because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-youre wrecking it. 
A:  but i didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly. 
Q:  i'm sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me. 
A:  fine, i'll give the suit back.  
Q:   hey, you think, you can keep it another night?  
A:  santa? really? 
Q:  yes, is that okay? 
A:  did your dad ever dress up like santa? 
Q:  no. 
A:  then it's okay!  
Q:  no! why does he have to go? 
A:  because, if santa and the holiday Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas! 
Q:  fine, i-i give up. santa, santa can stay. 
A:  well, i'll stay, but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah? 
Q:  yeah? 
A:  my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of Egypt.  
Q:   hi. 
A:  hey, you have got to try this cheesecake. 
Q:  oh, yknow i'm not that much of a sweet tooth. iWow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?  
A:   it was at the front door. when i got home. somebody sent it to us. 
Q:  chandler, this is not addressed to you. this is addressed to mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief. 
A:  ino! i didn't read the box before i opened it. and you can't return a box after you've opened the box. 
Q:  why, why not? 
A:  because it's too delicious. 
Q:  chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong. 
A:  no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  Mommas Little Bakery.  I feel terrible, Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person. 
Q:  all right, i should get going, big day a work. yknow im in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead. 
A:  so 
Q:  okay.  
A:  oh, whats at 800? 
Q:  my god, i cant believe this! i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable! 
A:  well, maybe since the age of 9, frannies made some new friends. 
Q:  yknow, she tried to undress me too. 
A:  i used to undress my cousin glenn.  
Q:  hi! 
A:  another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again! 
Q:  so just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem? 
A:  i cant seem to say goodbye. 
Q:  are you serious?! chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more? 
A:  well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?! 
Q:  it was cheesecake. it was fine. it had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva! 
A:   yknow what? forget it! we are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake. 
Q:  yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted. 
A:  good idea. where do you want to go to lunch? 
Q:  the lobby of chandler and rachels building, chandler and rachel are returning from lunch.] 
A:  well, thank you for lunch. 
Q:  what? wait a minute, i didnt pay, i thought you paid! 
A:  so apparently we just dont pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see? 
Q:   its still there!  
A:  mrs. braverman must be out.  
Q:  she could be out of town. maybe shell be gone for months. 
A:  by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake. 
Q:  no that could kill her. 
A:  well, we dont want that. 
Q:  no so were protecting her. 
A:  but we should take it. 
Q:  but we should move quick. 
A:  why? 
Q:  because i think i just heard her moving around in there. 
A:  go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go!  
Q:   oh my god! that is so good! 
A:  im full, and yet i know if i stop eating this, ill regret it. 
Q:  oh its umm, its tofu cake. do you want some?  
A:  what are you doing tonight? 
Q:  huh? uh  
A:  dude! dude!  
Q:  oh!  sorry. uh, ive got those plans with Phoebe, why? 
A:  oh really? uh, monica said she had a date at 900. 
Q:  what?! tonight?! 
A:  thats what monica said. 
Q:  joey and rachel's, rachel is eating the cheesecake and chandler enters and catches her in the act.] 
A:  are you eating the cheesecake without me?! 
Q:   mm-mmm.  
A:  i will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.  How can you eat the cheesecake without me?! 
Q:  oh, what are you going to do?! are you gonna go run tell monica?! are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law! 
A:  yknow what? i dont trust you with this cake anymore! and i got it first, and Im takin it back!  
Q:  what?! what?! 
A:  oh yes! 
Q:  wait a minute! 
A:  oh yes! 
Q:  oh no-no-no-no-no, no you dont!  
A:  oh yes! oh yes! 
Q:  you think i trust you with it?! no! were gonna split it! you take half and I take half! 
A:  well thats not fair, youve already had some! 
Q:  what? oh, well then yknow what? i think monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy. 
A:  what do we use to split it? 
Q:  okay!  all right, pick a half. 
A:   okay well, this side looks bigger. uh Theres more crust on this side. Yknow? So, maybe if I measured 
Q:  oh for god sake just pick a piece! 
A:  all right, ill pick that one.  
Q:  thats also the smaller piece.  okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and dont come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast.  Oh!!!! 
A:   ohhh! 
Q:  okay, you gotta give me some of your piece. 
A:  oh-ho-ho-ho-no! no! no switching! no sharing, and dont come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my  
Q:  oh! yay! look! theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it! 
A:  stick to your side! 
Q:   there it is! oh, look at that! isnt mother nature amazing? 
A:   thats a plane! 
Q:  okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly.  
A:   no, im not! 
Q:  then why are you wearing monicas jacket? 
A:  because its flattering!  come on monica! come on Monica!  
Q:  monica and chandlers bedroom, monica is sleeping and chandlers sitting in bed, wide awake.] 
A:   monica! 
Q:  shes sleeping. 
A:  i know, just quick-quick question, quick question. which one was deep Impact and which one was Armageddon? 
Q:  deep impact was the one with robert duval, armageddon is whats going to happen to you if you wake me up. 
A:  sorry, i just cant sleep. Ooh!  Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover Im like  
Q:  it is in the living room where there is also a light! and no one will kick you in the shin. 
A:  what?!  ow!  
Q:  monica and chandler's kitchen, chandler has a jug of milk in his hands and decides to make some warm milk. He opens up the cabinet to get a pot and manages to knock several other pots onto the floor making a lot of noise.] 
A:  shhhhhhhhh!!!  im sorry, i thought maybe id make some warm milk and it would help me sleep. 
Q:  with a wok?  i thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep. 
A:  it got interesting! damn you oprah! 
Q:  here, let me make the milk, im up anyway. 
A:  hey, yknow what we can do? yknow, now that we are up? we can just like talk to each other all night long, yknow like we did when we were first going out. Itd be fun! 
Q:  okay that does sound like fun. 
A:  okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh? 
Q:  the second sister dies?! 
A:   no. no, i-i was, i was talking about the book i was reading. 
Q:  the second sister dies in archie and jughead double digest? 
A:  thats correct. 
Q:  okay, heres your milk. what do you want to talk about?  
A:   what? what? what? 
Q:  are you still awake? 
A:  yeah! you? 
Q:  you do know that was me who just said that right?  Hey. As long as were both up 
A:   yeah?  i hope youre not thinking about cleaning the living room. 
Q:  what?! what are you doing?! 
A:  do you know what just happened? 
Q:  yeah. we-we had sex and then we fell asleep. 
A:  no. we were in the middle of sex and you fell asleep. 
Q:  nooo! no, thats not true. no, best time ever! yeah, you rocked me world!  
A:   monica? 
Q:  what?! 
A:  i was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. so please wake up so we can do it right! 
Q:  okay. okay, im ready. come on big fella! 
A:  okay. 
Q:  give me the good stuff. 
A:  yeah!  no! no! no! dont fall asleep! okay, I am going to make you some coffee.  And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor. 
Q:  that really was some of your best work. 
A:  hm-hmm, i told you!  i cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work. 
Q:  i have to be up in seven minutes. 
A:  well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes 
Q:  really?! 
A:  do you wanna? 
Q:  hey, yknow whats weird? after you guys get married, when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." Thats weird isnt it? 
A:  couldnt i just say, "this is ross?" 
Q:   uh, hello dad! monica and i just saw the house in the paper!  Yes were surprised!  Who did you leave a message with? 
A:   sorry!  
Q:  joey and rachel's, chandler is entering.] 
A:  joey! joe!  Full bag.  Beers still cold. Something terrible mustve happened here!  Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!  Stevie, I was never here!  
Q:  joey and rachel's, chandler has replaced rosita with his chair.] 
A:  my chair. now, if anybody asks, your name is rosita!  
Q:  hey chandler! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest? 
A:  yeah, id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore. 
Q:  well what if i told you, you can do it in my apartment? 
A:   are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year? 
Q:  i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000.  
A:  thats awesome! thats great! what made you do it?! 
Q:  well, its a long story, but umm i broke joeys chair 
A:  whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joeys chair? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  i thought i broke joeys chair! thats why i replaced it with mine! 
Q:  ohhhhh. thats how it got fixed! 
A:  well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it? 
Q:  noo!  angels. 
A:  im gettin my chair back!  
Q:  well, it looks like it wasnt heeled after all! yeah! so, i guess this chair is mine now!  
A:  joey you broke my chair!! 
Q:  uh-huh! nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! all right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back! 
A:  i think i should get the chair!  
Q:  how do you figure? 
A:  because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me! 
Q:  no-no-no! this chairs not going anywhere. 
A:  well, wheres the logic in that?! 
Q:  the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half! 
A:  so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing!  
Q:  thats right! 
A:  what are you guys? like a gang or something?!  
Q:   hey. 
A:   shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29. 
Q:  late thirties? oh come on you guys! is it just me? am i overreacting to this? 
A:  no rach, its not just you. my thirtieth birthday certainly wasnt that much fun.  
Q:  how hot do i look in this, huh?! 
A:  ross, a sports car? wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there? 
Q:  werent you asked to leave sonny?  
A:   would you put that back on?! monicas gonna be here any minute! 
Q:  but it hurts my joeys apple. 
A:   okay, for the last time. its not named for each individual man.  
Q:   youve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely. 
A:  oh well, not as lovely as you. i mean, i cant believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!  And you! I cant believe that you would have a tux thats thirty years old!  
Q:  its older than that. ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo. 
A:  ohh!  
Q:   hey! everybody hide! hide! i saw her! shes coming! 
A:  okay! okay! everybody down! everybody down!  
Q:  crap.  
A:   okay, everybody stay here. i will find out whats going on.  
Q:  heyyy!! you got the door open!!  
A:  hey-hey are you drunk? 
Q:  nooo!  okay.  Whoa!  Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning  thirty.  So the bus boys took me out for some drinks.  I wanna puke on you later! 
A:  okay, here is the thing. we have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents! 
Q:  noo!!! 
A:  yes! 
Q:  noo!! 
A:  yes!! 
Q:  oh no! my parents have never seen me drunk!  that they know of. 
A:  okay, heres the thing. were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk. 
Q:  really?! you promise? 
A:  yeah, ill take care of it. 
Q:  okay. i love you so much.  
A:   okay we have to do something about your breath. 
Q:  what about your breath?!  
A:  thats still yours. okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised. 
Q:  okay. i can do that. 
A:  okay.  
Q:  monicas birthday, its just after the surprise.] 
A:  okay before we start the celebration, monica has to go put on her party dress. 
Q:  yay! 
A:  see?  here we go.  
Q:   paul! 
A:   phil. 
Q:  phil! 
A:  now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.  Okay,  youre doing great. Youre doing great. Youre doing fine.  
Q:  hey, whats going on? 
A:  monicas a little drunk. 
Q:  awwwww  
A:   go change!  she doesnt want her parents to know shes drunk. 
Q:  whats-whats going on? phils really pissed! 
A:  monicas wasted. 
Q:  maybe that will liven up this party. 
A:   okay, will you just go help her change please! 
Q:  no! no-no, i love it. thank you.  
A:  okay, open ours next. open ours next! 
Q:  now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys? 
A:  for my last birthday you gave me a hug!  okay, read the card! Read the card! 
Q:  okay.  happy birthday grandma! its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.  All our love Monica and Chandler.  Thats funny, yeah! 
A:  no-no-no-no! that was the joke! 
Q:   no, i know! i get it! its funny! 
A:  no, because youre not a grandmother! 
Q:   youre drunk! mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! maybe Im a little drunk.  
A:   oh thats great! right there! can we get some of that over here please?  There we go. 
Q:   hey! are those crab cakes?  did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready? 
A:   how are you feeling? 
Q:  i really wish that you wouldnt. 
A:   now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone. 
Q:   speech! speech! lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh? 
A:  pheebs!! 
Q:  oh-ho, i think its nice. 
A:  i think its necessary.  
Q:  oh man! 
A:  what? 
Q:   lift!! and slide! 
A:  okay, here we go. 
Q:  yeah, im sorry.   
A:  hey! howd it go? 
Q:   i dont like this anymore.  
A:  well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds. 
Q:  yeah, its just yknow 
A:   monica said wedding. 
Q:  oh! i would love to read a poem. 
A:  do you think you could get through a poem? 
Q:  okay. yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too. 
A:  too? 
Q:  sorry, im kinda keeping this one on the q.t. 
A:  well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking.  
Q:  oh!! 
A:  thats great! 
Q:  and-and-and not only that, im gettin a new brain!! 
A:  so great things are happening at work and in your personal life! 
Q:  wouldnt you love to do it just once?!  
A:  dont do it. 
Q:  what is that? 
A:  i think its the dying cat parade. 
Q:  it sounds like its coming from across the street. 
A:   oh my god! 
Q:  what? 
A:  yknow that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "Youre half Scottish right?" 
Q:  nooo!! 
A:  yes!!  Commercial Break 
Q:  no, there is no way! it can not be ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?! 
A:  why is your family ross?! 
Q:  he cannot play at our wedding! i mean everyone will leave! i mean come on, that is just noise! Its not even a song! 
A:  if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the Gang. 
Q:  central perk, monica and chandler are sitting on the couch. ross is sitting on the armchair.] 
A:  well, i feel like a snack! 
Q:  do you want some shortbread? eh thats scottish like you are. 
A:  oh no thanks. i dont like any thing from my scottish heritage. 
Q:  what?! 
A:  well its just my entire family was run out of scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.  
Q:  how did you know about that?! 
A:  we heard you play all the way from your apartment! 
Q:  were you the ones called the cops?! 
A:  thats not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.

Q:  yeah for like a half an hour one night! chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! Youre so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys are perfect for each other. Yknow, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just it-it fits. Yknow? And you just know its gonna last forever. 
A:  thats what you should say. 
Q:  what? 
A:  when youre marrying us; thats what you should say. 
Q:  really? i can do it? 
A:  id love it if you would do it. 
Q:  hey!  
A:  but those are the words! those exact words!

A:  what? 
Q:  just, i love you so much. just Its just sometimes it bothers me that Im never gonna have that feeling. Yknow when you meet someone for the first time and its new and exciting? Yknow that rush? 
A:  no. no, see when i first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating. 
Q:  okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that youre never gonna sleep with anybody else? 
A:  sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and im afraid even more sweating. 
Q:  even with me? 
A:  i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives. 
Q:  really? 
A:  well yeah! but now that i know that youre having these thoughts, Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.

Q:  hey! guess what i got for your wedding!  
A:  a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?

Q:  let me see that!  oh man! 
A:  the only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.  
Q:   oh. 
A:  well, youre welcome. and tell them were really glad theyre coming.

A:  im so pathetic! monica knows what she wants to say! you shouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing! 
Q:  well, why dont you just start with something simple. like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you. 
A:  yeah, im not sure i can do that.  
Q:  hi, i'm ross's little sister. 
A:   okay.

A:  all right, theres a nuclear holocaust, im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? 
Q:  now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!

Q:  no fair. i don't even have one. how come they get two? 
A:  you'll get one.

A:  no i don't! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!   
Q:  then all your stuff would be here. 
A:  well, what if all my stuff was here? 
Q:  then youd be going back and forth all the time, i mean it doesnt make any sense. 
A:  okay. what if we lived together and you understand what im saying?   
Q:  you wanted it to be a surprise.  
A:  oh my god.  
Q:  chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to fall in love with my best my best Theres a reason why girls dont do this! 
A:  okay!  okay! okay! i'll do it!  oh god, I thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it.

Q:  monica and chandler's, ross and joey are reading chandlers new vows.] 
A:  okay, what do you guys think? 
Q:   i have never known love like this. 
A:  you really like it? 
Q:  dude! how-how did you write this? 
A:  i stole monicas and changed the name. 
Q:  chandler, we still havent gotten an rsvp from your dad. 
A:  oh! right. umm, maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation. 
Q:  chandler! hes your father; he should be at the wedding. 
A:  i dont even know the man. okay? were not the close. i havent seen him in years. 
Q:  well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?! 
A:  well he doesnt have to know! its not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas. 
Q:  ooh, i think i wanna trade circles. 
A:  trust me, you dont want him there either. okay? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress. 
Q:  here!  
A:  whats this? 
Q:  its your suitcase. were going to las vegas. 
A:  are you serious?! i mean like eloping?! no more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well save!!  Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please? 
Q:  were going to las vegas to see your dad. its time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law. 
A:  yknow we already went over this and i won! 
Q:  no you didnt. oh and honey just so you know, now that youre marrying me, you dont get to win anymore. 
A:  look forget it okay? i dont want to go. i dont want to see him. I dont wanna. 
Q:  chandler, look i-i know that your dad embarrassed you. i know 
A:  no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearing speedoesThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack! 
Q:  hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? Thats a, thats a pretty great dad. 
A:  he had sex with mr. girabaldi! 
Q:  whos mr. girabaldi? 
A:  does it matter?! 
Q:  chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. okay? maybe its time that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your wedding youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life. 
A:  yeah o-okay, but im just doing this for you. 
Q:  yes! 
A:  so i really never get to win anymore? 
Q:   hm-mmm? 
A:  yeah, i just ordered a beer!  
Q:  i still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats. 
A:  no! no! i dont want him to know were yet! im not sure Im ready for that. And besides hes not gonna be too happy to see me either. 
Q:  why not?! 
A:  i dont know if ive told you this, but hes kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years 
Q:  what?! 
A:  yeah, hes made phone calls, written letters, he even came to new York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Yknow its all very Cats in the CradleI dont want to get into it.  Here we go. 
Q:  hello darlings. 
A:  and theres daddy! Commercial Break 
Q:  that cant be your father. 
A:  believe me, ive been saying that for years. oh my god! 
Q:  what? 
A:  thats mr. girabaldi playing the piano. 
Q:   for im loved by a pretty wonderful boy!  Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.

A:  it cant happen like this. okay? ill meet you back at the hotel.

A:   chandler.  
Q:  chandler? what an unusual name! you mustve had terribly fascinating parents. 
A:  oh, theyre a hoot. 
Q:  im not very fond of new york. queens i like.  Ooh, what is this sparkle something!  Honey! Huh? 
A:  actually monica and i are engaged. 
Q:   i see. well, i wish you both a lifetime of happiness.  So youre bald?

Q:  we?  
A:  i know it would make me happy, maam. 
Q:   you okay? 
A:  yeah. thanks for making me do this. 
Q:  amen! 
A:   when i was growing up i played the one on the far left. 
Q:  why?! whats happening to the coffee house?!  Oh!  
A:  yep! from now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.

A:  the young hot ball and chain. 
Q:   yknow what? actually im kinda glad theyre leaving cause uh, I need to talk to you about something. 
A:  whats up? 
Q:  well this uh, this may be a little awkward. 
A:  listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. im buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night. 
Q:  no, its Its not that. Umm, now what Im going to say to you, Im not saying as your friend. Okay? Im-Im saying as it as Monicas older brother.

Im-Im not kidding here! 
A:   hey, i hear what your saying, okay? and, thanks for the warning. 
Q:  no problem. 
A:  so are we friends again? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  okay.  you wont believe what monicas older brother just said to me! Opening Credits 
Q:  honey, we gotta go! 
A:   okay. heres a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces. 
Q:   i dont have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does. 
A:  yes, include more people in this.

Q:  so this is your office? 
A:  how did you guys find me? i knew i shouldve hid at the gym! 
Q:  what the hell are you doing?!

Q:  shes fine. she doesnt know youre gone. and she doesnt have to know, okay? Now come on, were going home. 
A:  no! no! no! i cant do that! 
Q:  why not?! 
A:  because if i go home, were gonna become the bings! i cant be the Bings! 
Q:  whats wrong with being the bings? 
A:  the bings have horrible marriages! they yell. they fight. and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games! 
Q:  chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room? 
A:  no. 
Q:  then you are neither of your parents! 
A:  its not just their marriage! i mean, look at yours. look at everybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And Ive met me; I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity. 
Q:  but look chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than i do. But I totally believe you can do this. 
A:  i want to. i love her so much, but im afr Its too huge.

Q:  chandler. will you see if your mom can give my resume to dennis phillips? Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thats just for ugly people. 
A:  what size shoes do you wear? 
Q:  uh, eleven, eleven and a half.

Q:  uh, i dont even really know where i left those. sorry. 
A:   those arent eleven and a half. 
Q:  keep dancing.  
A:  and the world will never know. 
Q:  hey! did you talk to dennis about me yet? 
A:  yes, i told him how talented you were. i told him all about days of Our Lives. 
Q:  no-no! no! no! you dont tell a broadway guy that! now he just thinks Im a soap actor. 
A:  but youre not just a soap actor. you are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet. 
Q:  hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor? 
A:  did it turn into sand? 
Q:  ohh come on, i love this song! come on, youll be fine.  
A:   no. no, i wont. do you know why i took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnt want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot. 
Q:  chandler, im gonna have you arrested. 
A:  why? 
Q:  no.  i was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!  
A:   hi! were checking out of the bridal suite.

A:  are you suggesting we dance our troubles away? 
Q:  no-no-no, im saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elses faces. 
A:  are you serious? 
Q:  im just thinking about your new bride at home. okay? do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down? 
A:  marriage advice? really?! 
Q:  im telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! arent these the same flowers?

Q:  five years?! chandler you have to tell him! 
A:  no! that would be so awkward! lookbesides, we work in different departments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in a while. Whats the big deal? It could be worse, its not like hes calling me Muriel.

A:  i think its best sir. 
Q:  but we really do need to find someone up here. the work is starting to pile up. Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.  
A:  yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.

Q:  yeah. listen to the slutty nurse. 
A:   youre going down. 
Q:   look honey, you dont have to do this, okay? Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity! Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love! 
A:  that means nothing to me.  come on! 
Q:  pride.

A:  no, it wasnt you. 
Q:  well then who? 
A:  i got a maid. yay! 
Q:   i hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then 
A:  uh honey, i know you dont like to relinquish control 
Q:  oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose! 
A:  look, shes really nice. okay? and she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges. 
Q:  did she really say that? 
A:  yes, i distinctly remember cause i thought it was a joke. now just give her a chance, okay? 
Q:  fine, i can do it.  whew. 
A:  whats the matter? 
Q:  okay.  
A:  see? i told you. 
Q:  she stole my jeans! 
A:   what? 
Q:  i have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them! 
A:  so she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you? 
Q:  dont you see? its the perfect crime! 
A:  she mustve been planning this for years! 
Q:  i will prove it to you! okay? about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain! 
A:  honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair? 
Q:  i guess. 
A:  so, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go snooping around her crotch? 
Q:  fine. im just glad i didnt give her my secret ingredient. 
A:  out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient? 
Q:  monica and chandler's, brenda is shaking out the rugs on the balcony as monica pouts in the living room.] 
A:   hi! 
Q:  hey! umm, i think brenda needs a raise. 
A:  how come? 
Q:  because i put my head between her legs. 
A:  to see her pants? 
Q:  theyre my pants! 
A:  are you sure? did you see the stain? 
Q:  no! i was just getting into position and then everything went dark. 
A:  god! she is not stealing from us! okay, will you let this go? 
Q:  fine.  Shes wearing my bra! 
A:  oh dear god! 
Q:  my pink flowered bra! i recognize the strap! 
A:  and yet you dont recognize that youre crazy. 
Q:  heres the plan! okay? im going to leave you get a look at Brendas bra! 
A:  heres another plan No! 
Q:  i would do it but she thinks im attracted to her! 
A:  why? 
Q:  did you not hear where my head was? come on! come on were a team! Were in this together! 
A:  i fear a jury will see it the same way! 
Q:  do this for me! come on, i catch you looking at womans breasts all the time! 
A:  you see that? 
Q:  do you see this?  
A:  all right. yes. okay. i get your point. but if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?! 
Q:  yes! absolutely. okay? look, youll know its mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip. 
A:  you need new clothes. 
Q:   what are you doing? 
A:  im leaning. this is where i lean. 
Q:  okay. (goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch. 
A:  brenda a bee! 
Q:  what? 
A:  yes! its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you! 
Q:  i think i know whats going on here. 
A:  you do? 
Q:  look, i know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.

A:  i thought we werent gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Yknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition. 
Q:  this is so unfair! the one thing i wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner! 
A:  you went home with the waitress. 
Q:  oh yeah, that was a pretty good night. 
A:  i cant believe you didnt tell me! you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty! 
Q:  oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!  
A:  my god! you must be good in bed! 
Q:  well, i was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!

Q:  well i I havent actually told her yet. I dont want to scare her off, yknow? 
A:  well, you have to honest with her! otherwise you may think that youre going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones. 
Q:   oh my god! you are gonna love me so much! i felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelor party. 
A:  what? 
Q:  yeah, i got this number from this guy at work and i hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?! 
A:  honey! thats crazy! i dont want you to get me a stripper 
Q:  come on! come on, itll be fun! itll make me feel so much better. 
A:  look, i appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. yknow? Im not a bachelor anymore. 
Q:  please! i feel so bad! just watch the hot woman get naked! 
A:  all right fine! but im only doing this for you! 
Q:  yeah! 
A:  and joey. 
Q:  thank you. all right, now who else do you want to invite? 
A:  ah, no-no-no just ross. ross and joey is embarrassing enough. 
Q:  uh actually, sorry i cant even make it. im seeing mona again tonight. 
A:  i understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party? 
Q:  so you uh, nervous about getting married? 
A:  what are you doing? 
Q:  look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. okay? Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun. 
A:  okay. i cant believe tomorrows the big day. 
Q:  how does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death. 
A:  youre right, this is more fun.

Q:  wait! wait! maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do. 
A:  could be. i mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Maam, are you also a stripper? 
Q:  maybe monicas playing a joke on ya. yknow? getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.

Q:  do you mind if i smoke in here? 
A:  oh actually, id rather you Yeah, go ahead. Were gonna have to burn that room down anyway. 
Q:  maybe she meant to get you a hooker.

A:  im watching the game, but im not deaf! 
Q:  yeah, i hated her. she was horrible to me in high school. but hey, it was a long time ago, Im in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something?  No Will no!

A:  i dont see any uh, cabs. maybe we should just walk? 
Q:  oh no, we cant walk! 
A:  what honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. lets go. 
Q:  hey! do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover? 
A:  whats going on? 
Q:  i cant walk. okay? okay? these boots were a huge mistake! 
A:  what? 
Q:  okay you were right! all right, i never should have bought them! Theyre killing me! One toe at a time! 
A:  so i was right. this is what it feels like to be right.  Its oddly unsettling. 
Q:  how are we gonna get home? maybe a piggy-back ride? 
A:  hop on. 
Q:  okay. wait, just give me a second, i need to just get my boots off first.  Ah Ooh Oohh Ohh Oh God Ohh Oh Ohh Ohhhh 
A:  honey, i know youre in pain right now, but im a little turned on.

A:  okay, ten blocks down. five to go. 
Q:   oh wait! stop! stop! stop! 
A:  oh im sorry! do you need a break? 
Q:  my boots in tan! hey! can you get a little closer so i can see the price? 
A:  i can see it from right here. itll cost you one husband. 
Q:  okay, im sorry. i think i can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots. 
A:   i dont have your boots. 
Q:  well i dont have them either. where are they? 
A:  well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while i chew on a bale of hay! 
Q:  okay.  god well, we gotta go back and get them! 
A:  honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again? 
Q:  okay, im never gonna wear them again. i just didnt get a chance to say goodbye. 
A:  yknow what? you can say goodbye to the tan ones. 
Q:  okay.  all right. 
A:  okay.  
Q:  bing! ho! and the bing-ette! 
A:  honey, you remember my boss doug right? 
Q:  hi. so good news, the divorce is final. i signed the papers this a.m. 
A:  i didnt know you and carol were getting divorced, im sorry. 
Q:  okay, ill see you tomorrow!  just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.  I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding? 
A:  no. 
Q:  thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party. 
A:  oh yeah. boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnt it? 
Q:  bing! were all set for tonight, 8 oclock. 
A:  oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. monica has to work. 
Q:  oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then. 
A:  oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either. 
Q:  oh? why not? 
A:  its the semi-finals of her botchy ball tournament. 
Q:  whats going on bing? does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something? 
A:  well now-now youre just talking crazy. 
Q:  so why cant the three of us go out together? 
A:  because uh we-we we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me. 
Q:  good god bing i well I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust. 
A:  yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya? 
Q:  bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club. 
A:  oh no-no-no, monica would freak.  but to hell with that bitch. 
Q:  oh bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh? 
A:  oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl. 
Q:  bingwhats this?!  
A:  its a hand. its a thing you use as a jack and coke holder. 
Q:  no, its a wedding ring. you gotta get rid of it. were gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there! 
A:  oh no-no-no! 
Q:  monica and chandler's, monica is eating dinner as chandler enters.] 
A:  hi honey im home. 
Q:  from the tequila factory? 
A:  it was awful. to get out of going to dinner with doug i told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird! 
Q:  come here. i can breath through my mouth. 
A:  yknow what the worse part was? i got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like Its a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives. 
Q:  i promise. hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year? 
A:  ooh, i dont know if were there yet. 
Q:  hey! i got you a present!! 
A:  oh my goodness! where did you hide it? 
Q:  i got it for your wedding and i ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here! 
A:  pheebs you didnt have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang 
Q:  oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom. 
A:  oh, okay. 
Q:  all right.  
A:  i kinda like it here. 
Q:  well i-i really dont remember the name of it. 
A:  well what did it do? 
Q:  well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something. 
A:  a vending machine? 
Q:  chandler! phoebes hogging the game! 
A:  who cares? its a stupid game. 
Q:  you only think its stupid because you suck at it. 
A:  i dont suck. its sucks. you suck. 
Q:  no! no-no! i love it! it is a great present! in fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card? 
A:  why do you want to play this game so bad? 
Q:  hey. 
A:  you are not going to believe what i did today! 
Q:  well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving. 
A:  i got good. i played this game all day and now i rule at it! they should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they dont. 
Q:  wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played ms. pac-man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?! 
A:  uh-huh, and i got all the top ten scores, i erased phoebe off the board! High five!  
Q:  what is the matter with your hand? 
A:  well ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty words. 
Q:  chandler, why would you do that? 
A:  because its awesome. 
Q:  you think this is clever? 
A:  well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after a-s-s it is a bit of a challenge. 
Q:  hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty. 
A:  it is when you put it together with that one. 
Q:  ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this cant be there. 
A:  come on, he wont even know what they mean. 
Q:  chandler! hes seven; hes not stupid. 
A:  have you talked to him lately? 
Q:  all right, look im just gonna unplug it. 
A:  no-no-no, if you unplug it, ill have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  No!  Hey look at that! Look at that, its still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM  Chip in it or something! 
Q:  honey you-you got to beat your scores! 
A:  with the claw?! 
Q:  all right fine. fine, ill do it. ive just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger. 
A:   pull my fingermy hand is messed up. 
Q:  chandler sucks! he couldnt have gotten this good! 
A:  i did.  but it came at a price. 
Q:  but ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this. 
A:  oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?! 
Q:  i know! 
A:  one more score to go! you can do it!  
Q:  dont touch her!! 
A:  all right! go left! go left! go right!! go right!! 
Q:   hi. 
A:  are you, are you high? 
Q:  i just had the most amazing bath. 
A:  really? i dont like baths. 
Q:  wait, you like them with me. 
A:  honey, its not the bath i enjoy, its the wet, naked lady. 
Q:  oh, baths are so relaxing! 
A:  really? what do you do? you just sit in there stewing in your own filth. 
Q:  how dirty do you think i am? im telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away. 
A:  honey, its 200 on a wednesday and im watching road rules, how stressed do you think I am? 
Q:   hey, chandler, you got a minute? i-i really need to talk to you. 
A:  oh! uh, yeah! is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk? 
Q:  well, neither. 
A:  oh my god, whats up?! 
Q:  i dont know. its-its just lately, Ive been feeling Okay, heres what it is  You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!  
A:  oh no-no, no you dont, just come back. 
Q:  all right. okay. you and monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean? 
A:  do you? 
Q:  it was different for you guys! i mean, i mean, you were both in the same place, right? 
A:  in london? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  yes. when monica and i were in london, we were both in london. 
Q:  you know what? this is a bad idea. forget it. forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me. 
A:  if that. 
Q:  monica and chandlers, monica comes from the bathroom as chandler enters.] 
A:  hey. 
Q:  boy, do i have a surprise for you! 
A:  sex on the balcony? 
Q:  no, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they? 
A:  what is it? 
Q:  i drew you a bath! 
A:  honey, i dont like baths! could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony? 
Q:  please, could you just try it for me? come on, i used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath! 
A:  well, this does butch it up a bit. 
Q:  i swear, if you try it, you will love it! 
A:  all right, if i do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony? 
Q:  bet i know how that discussions going to go.  
A:   all right, this isnt so bad. i like the flower smell! Which is okay, because Ive got my boat. 
Q:   so? 
A:  oh my god. 
Q:  i told you you were a bath person! hey, when you get out, maybe i can give you a facial! 
A:  im going to need a bigger boat. 
Q:  hello? 
A:  im in the bathroom, can you come in here? i think theres something wrong. 
Q:  you know what? i-i think ill wait out here. 
A:  im in the bathtub. 
Q:  oh.  whats wrong? 
A:  i drew my own bath, but i did it wrong! the waters tepid. the salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dont compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh! 
Q:  what? 
A:  the bath salts! theyre starting to effervesce! its different.  Its interesting. 
Q:  okay, lets talk about something else. 
A:  yeah! sure, sure. so, what was going on with you today? oh-oh-oh! 
Q:  well, i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey. he was talking about rules and right and wrong and 
A:  i had the exact same conversation. 
Q:  you did? what was he talking about? 
A:  i dont know! joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth! 
Q:   that was a long night. 
A:  all right, lets break this down. what exactly did he say to you? 
Q:  okay, he was talking about rules. 
A:  uh-huh. 
Q:  umm, and looking at people differently. 
A:  he didnt say anything about that to me. 
Q:  what did he tell you? 
A:  he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules. 
Q:  okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone. 
A:  but what did he mean by rules? 
Q:  wait a minute! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in! 
A:  because he was looking at her differently. 
Q:  and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules! 
A:  my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london! 
Q:  just a minute!  thats mrs. tribbiani! 
A:  you dont say anything. 
Q:  why would i say anything? that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies? 
A:  im not going to let you say anything. 
Q:  you just stay here!  
A:  oh, god!  
Q:  hey. 
A:  do i smell essential oils? 
Q:  yeah, im going to take a bath. im just going to get a magazine. 
A:  okay.  
Q:  what do you think youre doing? 
A:  l-leaving my troubles behind? 
Q:  i know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum. 
A:  oh, its so hard to care when youre this relaxed. 
Q:  fine, you can have the bath, but i am taking your boat. now youre just a girl in a tub!  
A:   hey! 
Q:  hi, bubbles. manly. well, i just thought i would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey. 
A:   you told her?! 
Q:  why? 
A:   because its a relaxing and enjoyable time! 
Q:  oh my god! a friend hes looking at differently, but its wrong. Its Rachel! 
A:  you like rachel?! 
Q:   hello? 
A:   yes were all in here and we would love for you to join us! 
Q:  oh, wow! yay! wow! hooray! oh, man!  
A:  ill Ill get you later! 
Q:  it sure is nice to do this together, isnt it? 
A:  yeah. and what youre doing feels so good. 
Q:  im not touching you. 
A:  youre not? 
Q:  its the salts. 
A:  oh, sweet lord. new realms of pleasure! 
Q:   no.  
A:  hey pheebs, whats up? 
Q:  you told me you hate massages! 
A:  buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning Dont let Phoebe in. 
Q:  okayoop! too late! im leaving! come on chandler lets go!  
A:  well, phoebe i thought idYeah, what the hell.  Opening Credits

Q:  oh, okay. here, why dont you let me do it? 
A:  oh no-no-no, i will do it. honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  Its locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked? 
Q:  no reason. i-i keep private things in there. 
A:  oh yknow, ive been living here a while and ive never seen whats inside that closet. What is, what is in there? 
Q:  feminine stuff. 
A:  dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff! 
Q:  chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! if you love me you-youll let it go. 
A:  fine. 
Q:  thank you!  
A:   love you. 
Q:   hello chandler, lovely day huh?  you!

Q:  monica and chandler's, chandler has a box of keys and is trying them on the secret closet when someone enters.] 
A:  i wasnt trying to open your closet! i wasnt trying to open your closet! I swear!  
Q:  whoa, monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. what are you doing? 
A:  monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats in it. 
Q:  why not? 
A:  i dont know! what could she possibly be hiding in here that i cant see?! 
Q:  i dont know. ooh, i bet its richard. 
A:  why would monica be keeping richard in here? 
Q:  well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or! 
A:  and here we go 
Q:  monica and chandler's, joey and chandler are still working on the door.]

Q:  easy there captain kirk. oh, do you have a bobby pin? 
A:  yeah.  oh no wait, im not an nine-year-old girl. 
Q:  then why do you throw like one? 
A:  maybe monica has a bobby pin. 
Q:  sure. "monica." 
A:  so, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming? 
Q:  uh, really good. really good. yeah, i should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I justI wish I didnt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think I think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face.  By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card? 
A:  thats a good idea. 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  okay.  so uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh? 
Q:  oh, i just I feel terrible. 
A:  well, its not your fault. what are you gonna do? not take her to the hospital? Yknow? Youre doing nothing wrong.  Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if youre in there, could you pass me my credit card? 
Q:  monica and chandler's, chandler is pounding out the hinge pins on the closet door to get it open.] 
A:  not to shabby, i got this all off myself using my wifes tools.  Oh my God! 
Q:    how did you get in there?! 
A:   youre messy.

A:  yes! and look, now that i know if i got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet. 
Q:  joey and rachel's, joey is drinking a gallon of orange juice as chandler enters.] 
A:  hey. 
Q:  hey. 
A:  so rachels all moved out huh? how are you taking it? 
Q:  well uh, i wanted to have a few beers, but uh, i got rid of those because Rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so its got a bit of a kick. 
A:  are you okay? 
Q:  monica and chandlers. chandler enters with a bouquet of roses.] 
A:  happy valentines! 
Q:   okay! ill be right out. im slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty. 
A:   candy and cookie. Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!   
Q:  yeah, just relax.

A:  i am trying! 
Q:   ive still got it! 
A:   why did you get me this? 
Q:  what is it? 
A:  its yelling bleeding dilating. Oh, the dilating 
Q:  is this the video of the baby being born? sweetie, this is phoebes. Why were you even watching it? 
A:  i thought maybe you got me porn for Valentines Day. 
Q:  chandler, if you thought i was going to get you porn for valentines Day  you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts!  Oh, wait a minute. Those arent stars. Anyway, you want to take a look? 
A:  well, im not really in a sexy mood right now. 
Q:  honey, whats going on? 
A:  well, remember the first time we saw jaws? 
Q:  mm-hmm. 
A:  how long it took to go back in the water? 
Q:  chandler, we cant let this tape wreck valentines day! 
A:  you dont know. you didnt see it. 
Q:  child-birth, its a natural thing! its beautiful. 
A:  oh, beautiful? really? beautiful? you think this is beautiful?  
Q:  oh! oh, my god! no wonder my mother hates me! 
A:  see, honey, theres 
Q:  how long has it been this time? 
A:  90 seconds. 
Q:  thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all I did was think about it. 
A:  you know, it haunts me? up til now, the worst thing i ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver! 
Q:  okay, well, we have to get past this! why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed? 
A:  i can do that. 
Q:  okay.  
A:  okay. now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.  
Q:  oh, thank god! 
A:  oh, i know! 
Q:  oh, my god. 
A:  poor ross.  
Q:  rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? its here. 
A:  oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it dont watch it. 
Q:  why? you saw it? is it scary? 
A:  well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself. 
Q:  shes right of course not. Honey, get the tape. 
A:   this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay, here we go. 
Q:  okay.  ooh, my!  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?! 
A:  why have i seen this thing three times?! 
Q:  oh, my god!  
A:  wait, you guys, look! 
Q:  what? did her ass explode?! 
A:  no, the babys out! look, look! 
Q:  oh, look at those little fingers and toes! 
A:  and look how happy the mom is now! 
Q:  oh-oh! okay, shes kicking! 
A:  oh!  shes growing inside you. 
Q:  whoa!! 
A:  oh!  
Q:  wow that was a big one. 
A:  i think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me. 
Q:   oh hey you guys! 
A:  oh hey! 
Q:  uh-huh,  and you? 
A:  no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist. 
Q:  okay, good. 
A:  why? 
Q:  well last night, i met monicas. 
A:  what? 
Q:  yeah, i had a date with this guy, and i swear to god, he is her other half. 
A:  come on, dont be crazy.  you dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?  
Q:  of course, of course. 
A:  a tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe! 
Q:  oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet. 
A:  luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about. 
Q:  oh, im so sorry. um, and maybe im wrong! i butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more. 
A:  you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him? 
Q:   soul mate. 
A:   what? 
Q:  not really. 
A:  whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No? 
Q:  oh, id like a latte. oh yknow what? if youre gonna talk about me, Im gonna go with you.  
A:  what are you doing?! 
Q:  nothing! i swear to god i didnt know you guys would be here! and the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So 
A:  i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife! 
Q:  so Ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things. 
A:  cheese you say? thats some pretty smelly work, huh don? 
Q:  excuse me? 
A:  cheese, its smelly. you must smell a lot of the time too.

A:  okay.  
Q:  umm, wait! do you want to set the mood a little? 
A:  okay. uh, well dim the lights, dim the lights.  Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.

Q:  another hospital room, chandler and monica enter and start making out.] 
A:  should we tell rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers? 
Q:  we could, or we can have sex in it. 
A:  well let me think about that, while i remove my pants!  
Q:  does that sound like janice? 
A:  if its not, then theres two of them. and that would mean its the end of the world! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hi. 
Q:  oh not bad. do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass? 
A:  weirdest thing. did i hearMother of God its true! 
Q:  chandler bing! 
A:  jan-janice! 
Q:  oh, this should be easy. i have a very wide pelvis. you remember Chandler. 
A:  janice i didnt even know you were pregnant! whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?

A:  its incredible, i mean one minute shes inside you and then 47 hours later here she is. 
Q:  ohhh.  
A:  so, do you know what youre gonna call her yet? 
Q:  thats not her name! im sorry, she just doesnt feel like an Isabella. 
A:  so then i guess ferdinad is out. 
Q:  ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be. 
A:  you do? 
Q:  yeah, ive had them picked out since i was fourteen. 
A:  oh no, its gonna be named after some snack or baked good isnt it? 
Q:  a janitorial closet, monica and chandler are emerging slowly.] 
A:  that was amazing. 
Q:  i know. hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby. 
A:  and if not, we got to do it on a bucket. 
Q:  wheres my granddaughter? ive been practicing my magic tricks. 
A:  he pulled a quarter out of my ear! 
Q:  so when do i get to meet emma and show her this?  
A:  okay. wow. 
Q:   hey chandler, can i talk to you for a second? 
A:  sure. 
Q:  dude i just did something terrible. 
A:  that was you?! i thought it was jack! 
Q:  no! no, that was jack! rachel thinks i asked her to marry me! 
A:  what?! why does she think that? 
Q:  because it kinda looked like i did. 
A:  again, what?! 
Q:  okay well, i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand 
A:  as we all are at some point during the day. 
Q:  it wasnt my ring! it fell out of rosss jacket! and when i knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing! 
A:  ross had a ring?! and he was gonna propose? 
Q:  i guess. 
A:  and you did it first?! this is gonna kill him! you know how much he loves to propose! 
Q:  i know! i know its awful. 
A:  well, what did she say? 
Q:   she said yes. 
A:  does ross know? 
Q:  oh god, what the hell am i going to tell him? 
A:  well maybe you dont have to tell him anything. 
Q:  oh, i like that. yeah 
A:  if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass! 
Q:  i want a baby. 
A:  honey, weve been over this. i need to be facing the other way. 
Q:  come on! come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available? 
A:  im so tired.  yeah okay, but no foreplay. 
Q:  well im peeking.  oh my god! 
A:  hello sir, you know monica. 
Q:  the janitors closet, chandler and monica are trying to figure out what to do now.] 
A:  look, we cant stay in here forever. 
Q:  oh, i still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! he didnt make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees! 
A:  this is okay. were all adults here; theres nothing to be ashamed of. Now, lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.  
Q:  of course. ill always be your dad. 
A:  i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnt for fun. 
Q:  it wasnt fun?! 
A:   why? why-why-would youwh-why  Look, I just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want. 
Q:  well you gotta get at it princess! when your mother and i were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thats how I got my bad hip. 
A:  thats funny, this conversations how i got the bullet hole in my head. 
Q:  but pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor? 
A:  seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall. 
Q:  a hallway, chandler is following joey.] 
A:  you still havent told rachel you werent really proposing? 
Q:  no! she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out. 
A:  joey, you have to tell her whats going on! and what did it look like?! 
Q:  i didnt look at it. stupid babys head was blocking most of it. 
A:  go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out. 
Q:  look, its not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me. i dont want to hurt her. 
A:  okay, look, just do it gently. 
Q:   hey dad! 
A:  hey. 
Q:   so sexy.  Honey. 
A:  yea yea.  
Q:  honey why dont you go lie down. 
A:  no, no, ross and rachel will be back soon and then i gotta go to the office  Am I producing them? 
Q:  whyre you so tired? 
A:  couldnt sleep last night you know, then i started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldnt sleep.  Yknow? I was like, if I fall asleep now Ill get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now Ill get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldnt fall asleep. 
Q:  see this is what i was afraid of, i didnt think i should be here either but somebody  said hed be over it by now. 
A:  hey, what do i know? i wanted to get a bigger gorilla. 
Q:  boston is down, atlanta is down, houston is down, i could go on and on but instead of boring you Ill go straight to my forty two point plan.  
A:  walter . 
Q:  ok if everyones on board, its settled, chandler,  Chandler? 
A:  yep. 
Q:  are you on board? 
A:   yes.

Q:  oh yeah . 
A:  okay, you know how that people say that tulsa is the paris of Oklahoma? 
Q:  what? who says that?

Q:  thank you. 
A:   what is wrong with emma? 
Q:  ms. mckennas office, chandler enters.] 
A:  umm maam, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I dont think I can move to Tulsa. 
Q:  what? 
A:  its a funny story, actually.  i kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said Id move to Tulsa, I didnt really know what I was saying. 
Q:  you fell asleep? 
A:  but only because i was up all night worried about this meeting, aint that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, heres the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wont go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is ItalyPlease dont make me go there! 
Q:  chandler, i

Q:  wait a minute, you can't go to tulsa. maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week. 
A:  i'm sorry buddy, but i don't think i'm gonna be able to make it.

A:  really? 
Q:  chandler and monica's apartment] 
A:   hey! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  i've got good news! 
Q:  you got out of the whole tulsa thing? 
A:  okay, i have news. you don't have to move to tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job. 
Q:  so you're gonna be gone four days a week?  No. 
A:  i'm sorry, are you just used to saying that? 
Q:  no. i can't be away from you for that long. 
A:  really? 
Q:  yeah, you're my husband. i'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year. 
A:  that's fast math! we could use you in tulsa. 
Q:  honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you. 
A:  hey, you said that without gagging! 
Q:  excuse me? 
A:  i know what she's talking about. 
Q:  oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist. 
A:  he saw a therapist? 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  what are you doing? 
A:  looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa. 
Q:  that's so sweet. find anything? 
A:  slim pickings. 
Q:  nothing, huh? 
A:  no, 'slim pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite. 
Q:  'slim pickings'...that is so cheesy. 
A:  'so cheesy' also has an opening. 
Q:  honey, that's okay. i actually know this woman, nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something. 
A:  can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa. 
Q:  chandler and monica's apartment] 
A:  honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do. 
Q:  you're right.  maybe i shouldn't go. 
A:  what? 
Q:  so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa. 
A:  how far outside? 
Q:  manhattan. 
A:  and you're thinking of taking it?  so before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job,  me,  new job. 
Q:  i'm gonna miss this hand! okay i know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
A:  what happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'? 
Q:  well, if you really think about it, i mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend. 
A:  i think you should take the job. 
Q:  really? 
A:  yeah. i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey. 
Q:  he's a brilliant diagnostician! 
A:  diagnostician or boo-boo fixer? 
Q:  why? why? i know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!' 
A:  does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy? 
Q:  hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college! 
A:  that was not a security blanket! that was a wall-hanging! 
Q:  i got held up at dr. gettleman's office. there was some guy that freaked everybody out. 
A:  well, you got here just in time. i really have to go buddy.  
Q:  promise to call me when you land. 
A:  of course i will call you. i love you. 
Q:  bye chandler. 
A:  awww.  bye! 
Q:  bye honey.  
A:   what's the matter Joe? 
Q:  i'm mad at you for leaving! you're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase. 
A:  any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?

A:  no i'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all. 
Q:  oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?

A:  yeah, he came up... 
Q:  well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.  
A:   were you there? 
Q:  joey's apartment. joey is reading a 'busty ladies' magazine when chandler enters.] 
A:  hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks. 
Q:  ooh. i-i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering lines. 
A:   well, thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it. 
Q:  i know, right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this? 
A:  monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she's ever met. 
Q:  seriously? she actually said that? 
A:  yes! am i crazy to be this upset? 
Q:  nooooo! being funny is your thing! 
A:  yeah! 
Q:  without that, you just got "lame with women". 
A:  ye....  
Q:  monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...  
A:  hey! 
Q:  heeeyy! hey! 
A:  what are you guys talking about? 
Q:  uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny.  
A:  you got a man who's a nanny...? you got a manny...?  
Q:  ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister! 
A:  if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would have brought more pizza.  
Q:  okay, okay... chandler you... you stop it!  
A:  what is so funny about that?  
Q:  well, i don't know... i-it's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!  
A:  did you tell her what we talked about?  
Q:  yeah.... 
A:  so those were pity laughs? pity laughs?  
Q:  honey, listen... you have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey. 
A:  oh yeah? is he funnier than me? 
Q:  well, you're... you're different funny... i mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks... 
A:  i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside. 
Q:  monica and chandler's apartment. monica and joey are sitting at the dinner table. Chandler comes from the bedroom with his suitcase.] 
A:  well, i'm off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com. 
Q:  honey, you can relax. last night at work, geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore. 
A:  really...? see... that's the thing you gotta keep it smart, people! 
Q:  okay, don't miss that flight. you know i love you. 
A:  i love you too.  And... I like you as a friend.  
Q:  allright. see you later! 
A:  see ya!  
Q:  central perk. joey sits at a table and chandler and monica enter.] 
A:  hi! 
Q:  hey... hey listen... what do you guys know about investments? 
A:  how come? 
Q:  well, i just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.  I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots! 
A:  do you have any ideas? 
Q:   oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard! 
A:   oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica! 
Q:  my dad told me. they play golf together. 
A:  oh, well... maybe i'll join them some time. i just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face. 
Q:  hi i'm joey. this is chandler. 
A:  so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache? 
Q:  actually, he is buying a much bigger place. it's got a great view of Central Pa..... 
A:  mmm that's enough about you! 
Q:  all the appliances are included. there is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...  
A:  no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple. 
Q:  well, you seem pretty insulted by that. what? i'm not good enough for you? 
A:  we're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man!  You don't think he's here, do you?  
Q:  you know what it is? it's a nice place but i gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see...  Yeah, I could see it. 
A:   Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God! 
Q:  what? 
A:  there's a tape here with monica's name on it. 
Q:  ooh! a tape with a girls name on it. it's probably a sex tape...  Wait a minute... This says Monica...  And this is Richard's apartment...  
A:  get there faster!  
Q:  monica and chandler's apartment. only chandler is there with the videotape in his hands, standing in front of the TV set.] 
A:  i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?  Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.  
Q:  hey dude, what's up? 
A:  don't judge me, i'm only human! 
Q:  did you take that tape? 
A:  i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it? 
Q:  i don't know. who'm i'm married to? 
A:  some girl...!? 
Q:  she hot? 
A:  yeah...!? 
Q:  how did she get me to settle down? 
A:  allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it? 
Q:  guess i don't know. my experience if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya... 
A:  then you're gonna have to watch it for me. 
Q:   what? whoo... what? 
A:  just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... Please? 
Q:  all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...  
A:  why am i hearing cheering? 
Q:  well it's okay, its like... its just a football game. 
A:  football? just football? 
Q:  yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing. 
A:  it's football... it's just football... this is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What the...  What are you doing? 
Q:  so you stole that tape from richard's apartment? 
A:  whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star! 
Q:  why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it? 
A:  because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches. 
Q:  is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache? 
A:  this is about you and richard. he's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants. 
Q:  isn't that sad? i mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him. 
A:  oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache! 
Q:  chandler, this is not our problem. we've got each other. That's all that matters. 
A:  yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air... 
Q:  cowboy boots? i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!  
A:  oh, good, good. play more, 'cause i wanna see how it ends. 
Q:  that's not me! 
A:  what...? that's not you! life is good again! ride 'em cowgirl! 
Q:  that bastard taped over me!  
A:  is that a problem? 
Q:  what if something gets broken, they're so expensive. 
A:  what is the point of having them if we never use them? 
Q:  ok, but if something gets broken, and then the queen comes over.. 
A:  i will explain it to her. 
Q:  next up is a marching band from muskogee, ok. 
A:  muskogee! that's like four hours from tulsa. woo hoo! 
Q:  oh my god! 
A:  aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives? 
Q:  yeah! i totally forgot i'm supposed to be there. i can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. <Chandler grabs Joey's left arm and pushes the sleeve up> <Joey looks> Oh! Stupid long sleeves. 
A:  what are you going to do? 
Q: 00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot. 
A:  well you proved them wrong. 
Q:  careful. <hands chandler a china plate> careful. CAREFUL! <Chandler is startled and nearly drops the plates.> Sorry. 
A:  i'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.. 
Q:  i know, after you left the store, i chose different ones. 
A:  why? 
Q:  well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me. 
A:  oh suddenly, flowers are feminine? < Phoebe comes in> 
Q:  well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler. 
A:  i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma. 
Q:  connected? i mean.. to what? she's.. she's  a lump. 
A:  you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry> 
Q:  okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby? 
A:  no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right? <Ross and Rachel pause and ponder this> 
Q:  well actually... 
A:  actually what? 
Q:  well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma would go to my parents. 
A:  what? 
Q:  uh.. who has to die for me to get her? <Everyone is looking around and at Joey with looks of 'what?' on their faces> Commercial Break. 
A:  so if monica's not around, then i'm not good enough to raise Emma? 
Q:  yeah he's lying. he looked down. <Joey looks to Phoebe and she nods in agreement> 
A:  well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! 
Q:  no you're all about the fun. 
A:  look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable? 
Q:  no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together. 
A:  ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up. 
Q:  i lie better then that, right? 
A:  so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me? 
Q:  hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner. 
A:  oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly? 
Q:  ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom. 
A:  yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong father figure and I never will be. 
Q:  no you learn these things. you grow into it. 
A:  yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it. 
Q:  i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts. 
A:  oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "go to your room! You're grounded"? 
Q:  can you hear me say "you're grounded"? 
A:  you said that to me last week. 
Q:  hey dude, you okay? sorry about before. 
A:  oh no thats okay, you're totally right. i don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. 
Q:  ew! gross. <Amy runs towards Rachel and Rachel puts her arm out, hand on Amy's head and Amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, Rachel is moving backwards towards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to the floor> <Everyone is shocked and Monica faints and Ross catches her> 
A:  alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now. 
Q:  mon, i'm so sorry. 
A:  okay. thats better. now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it. 
Q:  sorry. 
A:  by the way, that fight was totally arousing. 
Q:  dude. well done. you know what? if i die, and rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma. 
A:  oh yeah? well thanks. 
Q:  so, so now do i get joey? 
A:  okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose. <Ross ponders that and walks away> 
Q:  she needs changing. 
A:  oh no no no.. i'll get her. i'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first. COMMERCIAL BREAK 
Q:  hey, does monica know about her broken plates yet? 
A:  nope... 
Q:  broke them all, huh? 
A:  yep... 
Q:  you gonna tell her? 
A:  nope...  hey... so i'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time. 
Q:  like only if the queen comes? 
A:  maybe not even then.  
Q:  this kitty is mittens and this one is fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies. 
A:  yep.  that's a lot of cats jo lynn.  single are ya?  
Q:  hey.  how come you're answering your own phone?  where's your crazy assistant?  
A:  what's up joe? 
Q:  okay, what have we always wanted to do together? 
A:  braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach? 
Q:  no, no, no.  when you get home tomorrow night, you and i are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .  courtside! 
A:  courtside?  oh my god. 
Q:  yeah.  maybe michael jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee. 
A:  that's so cool.  i'll let monica know.  
Q:  hello? 
A:  joey just called.  he's got courtside knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night. 
Q:  really?  but tomorrow night is the only night i get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week. 
A:  but hey, it's courtside.  the cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . .   That's not the way to convince you. 
Q:  chandler look, i don't want to be one of those wives who says, "you can't go to the game.  You have to spend time with me."  So, if you could just realize it on your own . . . 
A:  i know.  you're right.  i want to see you too.  i've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?  He's really looking forward to this. 
Q:  tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.  tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.  Tell him that what little time we have is precious. 
A:  yeah, ah, ah . . .  i'll think of something.  
Q:  hi. 
A:  hey. 
Q:  welcome home. 
A:    Oh well, look at you. 
Q:  yeah.  what do you think? 
A:  well, it looks great.  it's just that . . . well, i'm wearing the same thing underneath.  So . . . 
Q:  oh. 
A:  see what i mean . . .   
Q:  just a second. 
A:   no, no, no, no, no.  joey can't know that i'm here. 
Q:  why not? 
A:  because i didn't know how to tell him that i couldn't go to the knicks game.  So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa. 
Q:  so, you lied to him? 
A:  achhh.  it's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.   Except with you. 
Q:  cheers.    okay, buh-bye.   
A:  you know, it's funny.  i've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.    Hi ya. 
Q:  you might want to keep practicing. 
A:  yah.  
Q:  dude, come home! 
A:  what? why? 
Q:  come . . .  home. 
A:  look i, i can't.  what's going on? 
Q:  all right look.    if you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna. 
A:  no! 
Q:   i just heard him! 
A:   can you . . . hear him . . . now? 
Q:    no.   all right, i'm going in. 
A:  no! wait! 
Q:  i heard him again! 
A:   all right, look.  just stay there.  i'm coming home. 
Q:  okay.  great.  i'll see you when you get here.  i'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out. 
A:  is that really necessary? 
Q:  chandler, you have to tell joey that you're not in tulsa. 
A:  don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?    I heard it. 
Q:  i don't want him to think that i'm having an affair. 
A:  all right.  i've got a plan.  i'll go down the fire escape. 
Q:  yes, because all good plans start with, "i'll go down the fire escape." 
A:  hear me out woman.  i'll go down the fire escape.  then, i'll wait for a while.  Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.  Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here. 
Q:  aren't you afraid that joey's going to figure all of this out?   I heard it.  
A:  i'm just going to wait for a little while. 
Q:  scary pigeon's back? 
A:  it's huge. 
Q:  wow!  that didn't take long.  i thought you said tulsa was, like a three hour flight. 
A:   well, you're forgetting about the time difference.  
Q:   chandler!  you're home! 
A:  that's right.  you're husband's home.  so, now the sex can stop.  
Q:  what are you saying? 
A:  joey said that you're in here with another man. 
Q:  all right.  all right.  then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?    Bwa-ah-ah!  
A:   what is he doing? 
Q:   bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows. 
A:  all right.  well, i'll check the guest room. 
Q:    oh yeah.  i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier. 
A:  there's nobody here joe. 
Q:   whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here? 
A:   i climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet? 
Q:  what's going on? 
A:  i'm sorry.  i, i told you i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .  I didn't think you'd understand. 
Q:  i don't know what to say.  we shouldn't have lied to you. 
A:  yeah.  i feel so bad.  is there anything i can do to make it up to you? 
Q:   yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though i know you said you couldn't.  But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head. 
A:  i'm sorry.  that's the one thing i can't do.  i promised i'd be with Monica. 
Q:   you can go. 
A:  what? 
Q:  you should go to the game.  it's okay.  i want you to. 
A:  really?  you're gonna be okay? 
Q:  yeah, i'll be fine.  you know, maybe i'll stay here and practice the art of seduction. 
A:  you're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you? 
Q:  it's gonna be so hot!   
A:  okay, bye. 
Q:  thanks.    Here's your ticket. 
A:  hey, listen.  i'm never going to lie to you again, okay?  and i want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid. 
Q:  where are you going? 
A:  game's tomorrow night joe.  
Q:   uh-huh. 
A:   say goodbye elves, i'm off to tulsa. 
Q:  you're really not coming back? 
A:  yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. if i don't get it done, i'll be fired. 
Q:  it's so unfair, you don't even like your job! 
A:  so, who does? 
Q:  i can't get *enough* dinosaurs! 
A:  i'm sorry, i won't be here. 
Q:  it's just... it's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, i understand. 
A:  thanks.  i'll see you new year's day. 
Q:   you're not gonna be here new year's eve?? 
A:  did i not mention that? 
Q:  no! 
A:   and to all a good night!  *Opening Credits* 
Q:  chandler's office in tulsa, in the conference room. chandler's staff/co-workers are sitting round the table; chandler is walking around, when he notices a piece of paper attached to the back of his chair.] 
A:  all right everybody, i know that it's christmas eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  for writing "screw you, mr. bing!" on the back of my chair!  -- by the way, you can all call me chandler.  
Q:  hey. 
A:  hey. where've you been? 
Q:  i was, uh, checking out that insurance company's christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and i just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- so i stole ther ham.  
A:   you hear that? you may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here. 
Q:  my kid's in a play right now. 
A:  y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up!  i had a little talk with the boys in new york, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order. 
Q:   "a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet". 
A:  well, that's like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks! 
Q:  *now* it feels like christmas. 
A:  i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to. 
Q:  you can come to my house! 
A:  haha, no thanks! 
Q:  that was a nice pep-talk. 
A:  oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker. 
Q:  so, if you were home right now, what would you be doing? 
A:  typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional...  
Q:  okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet. 
A:  i can save you time ladies, i'm right here. 
Q:  we are looking for our christmas presents from monica. 
A:  what? that's terrible! 
Q:  no-no, we do it every year! 
A:  oh well, that, that makes it not terrible. 
Q:  don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok? 
A:  no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents! 
Q:  oh no, we have to! 
A:  no, you don't have to, and you can't because i, i live here too. 
Q:  well then, you should look with us. 
A:  why? 
Q:  chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for christmas? 
A:  no, i have a great idea for a present for her. 
Q:  chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you've just gotten her one great present? i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why? 
A:  if i help, we can find 'em faster! 
Q:  no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. 
A:  ok, pheebs, your turn. 
Q:  you got me a cola drink? 
A:  and, a lemon lime. 
Q:  well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater. 
A:  and last but not least.  
Q:  years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees... 
A:   ho, ho, ho! merry christmas! 
Q:  santa!  
A:  hey!  
Q:  what are you doing here, santa? 
A:  well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird...turtle-man? 
Q:  i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember? 
A:  what? 
Q:   what are you doing? 
A:  you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work! 
Q:  thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave. 
A:  why? 
Q:  because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it. 
A:  but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly. 
Q:  i'm sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me. 
A:  fine, i'll give the suit back.  
Q:   hey, you think, you can keep it another night?  
A:  santa? really? 
Q:  yeah, is that okay? 
A:  did your dad ever dress up like santa? 
Q:  no.

A:  good, god's speed, good people!  you're not gonna go? 
Q:  naah... i couldn't leave you alone. 
A:  ah. thanks. 
Q:  besides, i can't leave until their christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham. 
A:  ah.  chandler bing. 
Q:   ble-blah-blar blargh!  
A:  ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys! 
Q:  so is it horrible? is everybody working really hard?

A:  it is. did i... not tell you about her? 
Q:  umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. where is everybody else? 
A:  i sent them home. 
Q:  ohh, you are such a good boss! is she pretty? 
A:  uhh, uh... 
Q:   answer faster, answer faster! 
A:  i don't know! 
Q:   answer better, answer better! 
A:  i don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague. 
Q:  what does she do there? 
A:  oh, she's regional vice president; she's... just below me. 
Q:  she did what? 
A:  be-low me! 
Q:  *what*?? 
A:  well, she... she didn't win... 
Q:  alright, well, maybe i should let you and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work. 
A:  well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she's probably... 
Q:   oh chandler, stop talking! 
A:  honey, there's really nothing to worry about. 
Q:  okay. 
A:  i'm serious! 
Q:  okay! 
A:  merry christmas. 
Q:  merry christmas. 
A:  merry christmas, you guys! 
Q:  back in the conference room in tulsa] 
A:   the wife says "hi!". 
Q:  ah. fun conversation? 
A:  ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen. 
Q:  huh? really? -- hm, that'd be so terrible?  
A:  this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  
Q:  the conference room in tulsa again, chandler is trying to evade wendy] 
A:  whoa-ho, back off, missy!  
Q:   ...missy? 
A:  i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma? 
Q:  you are to me...  
A:   no,... no...  no!  look, i'm, i'm married! 
Q:  so? i'm married.  
A:  i'm *happily* married. 
Q:  oh. - what's *that* like? 
A:  right. so, i'm sorry... 
Q:  seriously? happily married. so that phone call before, that was ... happy? 
A:  well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. she's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us. 
Q:  london, chandler's hotel room. he was getting ready for bed when monica pays him a visit and they started talking] 
A:  i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight! 
Q:  really? 
A:  you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   whoa! whoa! whoa! what's going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out? 
Q:  well, not anymore. 
A:  but we don't do that. 
Q:  i know, i just thought it would be fun. 
A:  how drunk are you? 
Q:  drunk enough that i know i wanna do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage. 
A:   that's the perfect amount! 
Q:   y'know what's weird? 
A:  what? 
Q:  this doesn't feel weird! 
A:  i know. 
Q:  you're a really good kisser. 
A:  well, i have kissed over four women.  do you wanna get under the covers? 
Q:  hm-hmm! 
A:  okay!  
Q:  wow! you are really fast! 
A:  it bodes well for me that speed impresses you. 
Q:  we're gonna see each other naked. 
A:  yep! 
Q:  do you wanna do it at the same time? 
A:  count of three? 
Q:  one! 
A:  two! 
Q:  three!  
A:  well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined. 
Q:  eh, we weren't that close anyway! 
A:  eh!   
Q:  a hallway in the hospital, monica and chandler are talking.] 
A:  so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man? 
Q:  well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him. 
A:  y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this. 
Q:  i think you're better than you think you are. 
A:  really? okay, so... 
Q:   know when to stop. 
A:  y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay? 
Q:  yeah.  don't do the dance. 
A:  right!  
Q:  i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. 
A:  okay, all right, all right, all right! okay!  okay, here's something, here's something blue and new. 
Q:  you're so efficient. i love you! 
A:  let's go!  
Q:  no-no-no, wait! we need something old! 
A:  oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve. 
Q:  that'll work! 
A:  i don't think so. 
Q:  okay, now we just need something borrowed! 
A:   here just...take this.  
Q:  that's stealing! 
A:  no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress.  
Q:  ohh.  
A:  okay, one thing at a time.   
Q:  listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that. 
A:  ehh. 
Q:  eh, you work for that. 
A:  look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding. 
Q:  you do?! 
A:  yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do. 
Q:  oh, you're so sweet.  oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff? 
A:  eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. 
Q:  you thought about that? 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  how many kids were we gonna have? 
A:  uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy. 
Q:  what else did you think about? 
A:  well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old. 
Q:   y'know what? i-i don't want a big, fancy wedding. 
A:  sure you do. 
Q:  no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage. 
A:  you sure? 
Q:  uh-hmm. 
A:  i love you so much. 
Q:  okay, fine. let's talk about snow. -- do you think it's snowing in tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?  
A:  hey!  
Q:  what are you doing here? 
A:  i wanted to be with you. i missed you so much. 
Q:  hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most? 
A:  monica. 
Q:  got ya.  
A:  i never want to leave you again! 
Q:  but i thought if you left, you get fired. 
A:  turns out they can't fire me. because i quit. 
Q:  what, you, you really quit your job? 
A:  yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do? 
Q:  what do you really want to do? 
A:   i have *not* thought this through! 
Q:  oh my god! 
A:  i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it. 
Q:  no, i think that this is what you wanna do, i think it's great! 
A:  thanks! 
Q:  chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined. 
A:   ahh... 
Q:   thank you. 
A:   here, pass these, will ya..   
Q:  wha... are you kidding? i can't return this. 
A:  i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys. 
Q:  mine's is to lilian myers. 
A:  i don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits* 
Q:  monica and chandler's apartment, monica is cleaning up, chandler is sitting on the couch, checking the job offers in a newspaper.] 
A:  actuary... no. book-keeper... no. topless dancer...   hey, d'you know what i just realized? you are the sole wage earner. *you* are the head of the household. i don't do anything - i'm a kept man! 
Q:  good morning, tiger! i'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant. 
A:  i've got nowhere to go this morning. i'm unemployed! i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life. 
Q:  well, i just lost my erection. 
A:  i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself? 
Q:  you're supposed to find your passion in life. you can be whatever you wanna be now. it's exciting. 
A:  but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start. 
Q:  hey, wait a second. i can help you with this. you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files! 
A:  hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off! 
Q:   okay, i have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision. 
A:  how long was i in there? 
Q:  okay. let us start with the a's. advertising. 
A:  wait. advertising! that's a great idea! 
Q:  don't you want to look through the rest? 
A:  i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though. 
Q:  you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? ooh, now i get to use my shredder! 
A:  i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? "cheese. it's milk that you chew." "crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?" 
Q:  i got one. "socks. because your family's feet deserve the best." 
A:  honey? leave it to the pros. 
Q:  i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone. 
A:  "the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones." 
Q:  so, do you have any other question about advertising? 
A:  no, no. but let me show you what i can do. "bagels and donuts. round food for every mood." 
Q:  monica warned me you might do that. i actually think we might have something for you at the agency. 
A:  really? that's great! 
Q:  it's an unpaid internship. 
A:  it's funny. when you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid." 
Q:  come on now. monica has a good job. and it's not like you have a family to support. 
A:  actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now. 
Q:  chandler and monica's] 
A:  whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family. 
Q:  so you have to tell monica you don't want to have a baby right now? 
A:  yeah. 
Q:   okay, it's baby time. pants off bing.  didn't see you there geller. 
A:  yeah, ross is here so... 
Q:  hey. 
A:  hey. 
Q:  you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine. 
A:  oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits. 
Q:   sorry.  but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night. 
A:  oh god, i have to tell you something. you're not pregnant. 
Q:  what are you talking about? 
A:  that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it. 
Q:  you faked it? you couldn't have faked it! 
A:  oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises. 
Q:  guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that's ours! besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby? 
A:  that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while. 
Q:  like a month? 
A:  or a year? 
Q:  really, you want to wait a year? 
A:  it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. "pants. like shorts, but longer."  It'll probably be more than a year. 
Q:  i really wanna have a baby. 
A:  yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back. 
Q:  no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration. 
A:  i quit and you learn what i do? 
Q:  it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons. 
A:  i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 
Q:  it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?! 
A:  should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind? 
Q:  yes, please! 
A:  oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time. 
Q:  hey. so where's mon? 
A:  oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for rachel's birthday party tonight. 
Q:  and you're not helping? 
A:  i tried, but apparantly singing "i will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.  
Q:  yeah. 
A:  yes, bravo on the hot nanny. 
Q:  what? you really think she's hot? 
A:  are you kidding? if i wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now. 
Q:  thank you!  
A:  now that rachel's gone? 
Q:  would you stop staring at her? 
A:  i wasn't staring. i was leering. 
Q:  yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. you know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it. 
A:  looks like joey is doing allright with her. 
Q:  whazzup?? 
A:  seriously dude, 3 years ago. 
Q:  listen, can you do me a favor? i'm gonna be out today. can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly? 
A:  you don't trust him? 
Q:  wh - no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny". 
A:  is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now. 
Q:  you do appear right on the cusp of something. come on man, i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me? 
A:  allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it. 
Q:  well we gotta do something, ok? nannies like her don't grow on trees.  
A:  picturing that tree? 
Q:  hallway, joey get out of his appartment and chandler jumps out of his] 
A:  where you going, joe?  
Q:  for a walk. 
A:  oh. you mind if i join you? 
Q:  actually, that will be long. you know, i really need to organize my thoughts. 
A:  your thoughts? plural? 
Q:  allright, fine, i only have one thought! it's about the hot nanny, i gotta see her! 
A:  i'm afraid i can't let you do that, joe. 
Q:  now you're telling me i can't see her?? you guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there? 
A:  yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can't let you go. 
Q:  huh. interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of. 
A:  great novels? 
Q:  where the hell are joey and molly? i asked you to watch them. 
A:   i'm sorry, i got a little occupied. 
Q:  we have to stop them before something happens! 
A:   right behind you, big guy!  
Q:  see? why, gavin, why? right when i'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ...  and you do that ...   ENDING CREDITS 
A:   first i was afraid, i was petrified  
Q:   hey 
A:   hi 
Q:  listen, i think i've left something here. 
A:  oh, well someone left this . this is yours? 
Q:   no, but i like it. i think i left one of my rat babies. 
A:  oh, uh, well, i haven't seem it but if i do i'll let you know. 
Q:  chandler and monica's] 
A:  hey! 
Q:  yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what happened here last night? 
A:  sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!! 
Q:  ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about? 
A:  no! 
Q:  ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony. 
A:  our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will" 
Q:  right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS ! 
A:  so are you gonna...talk to her? 
Q:  why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's fine! 
A:  you know when "that's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits! 
Q:  no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah! 
A:  no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where you're moving? 
Q:  i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand. 
A:  dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life! 
Q:  well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner. 
A:  why did i get married?!  
Q:  central perk] 
A:  hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on going? 
Q:  not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants. 
A:  well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself.... 
Q:  that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again? 
A:  what are doing? you know i can only dish it out! 
Q:  i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me 
A:  maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing 
Q:  no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar. 
A:  did she go out with him? 
Q:  no. when he called, i...i threw the message away. 
A:  ah! the high road... 
Q:  you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me! 
A:  are you trying to get everybody divorced? 
Q:  you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one... 
A:  i thought i had to make the jokes! 
Q:  don't you have to be at work? 
A:  oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!! 
Q:  sorry...we were just leaving 
A:  we still got it! 
Q:  right, so that's a firm "no". i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out. 
A:  i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed 
Q:  this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone. 
A:  by drowning or...?! 
Q:  all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable? 
A:  well... 
Q:  hey, i need your help. 
A:  wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley Judd? 
Q:  look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my eyebrows shaped 
A:  i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please! 
Q:  you may be a sissy but i'll still . all right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don’t match! 
A:  it’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama! 
Q:  all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don’t look stupid for my pictures. 
A:  ok. first of all, this is green! 
Q:  what the hell am i supposed to do! 
A:  all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you. 
Q:  what, what. 
A:  ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his “business” partners. 
Q:  oh my god! 
A:  yeah, well, i guess you don’t need my help victor Victoria! 
Q:  ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help, but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad! 
A:  oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self-loathing touch. 
Q:  monica and chandler's] 
A:  and done! 
Q:  oh my god! i didn’t feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon 
A:  thanks. you wanna see what it looks like? 
Q:  yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look great! How you doing! 
A:  yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate. 
Q:  thank you so much. 
A:  no problem. 
Q:  listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it. 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands. 
A:  i am sorry i am late. you’ll understand when you’ll see Joey. 
Q:  honey, you’re just in time, i’m about to sing another song! 
A:  really? in front of all this people? 
Q:  and they love me! 
A:  oh my god! 
Q:  "tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..." 
A:  are those my wife’s nipples? 
Q:  oh? isn’t that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have let her go up again. 
A:  i gotta stop this. 
Q:  oh, who cares, they still love me! "i am so excited..." 
A:  you, touching yourself, out! 
Q:  your eyebrows look weird.  
A:  “jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine.” So you just touch yourself for anything? END 
Q:  you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you? 
A:  see, now, why would you assume that? just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries. 
Q:  oh my god. 
A:  wow. 
Q:  what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, i'm all set. 
A:  well, i think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? i mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood! 
Q:  monica and chandler's apartment. emma is there in her playpen, while Chandler is behind the couch.] 
A:  emma? emma? look at me! well, i think i'll go downstairs for a while.  
Q:  okay, just so you know, i'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours. 
A:  i don't do that.  
Q:  yeah. 
A:  today is the sixth. 
Q:  no, it's not.  
A:  yes, it's also 2003. 
Q:  oh my god. today's the sixth?! i may be done ovulating! i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant. 
A:  it's okay. go take the test and see if we're okay. 
Q:  okay.  
A:  tough crib. 
Q:  hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? there's only one here. 
A:  i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times. 
Q:  chandler! 
A:  i am not working. there's not much to do around here! 
Q:  we're okay. i'm still ovulating. 
A:  oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, i am not. 
Q:  so, let's do this. 
A:  i - i don't think i can. 
Q:  come on. i know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute. 
A:  because of emma. 
Q:  oh my god, emma. oh, sweetie, i forgot you were here. oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone. 
A:  sorry. 
Q:  unless... maybe we do it here. i mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age? 
A:  well, she's aware when we leave the room. she may notice if we start... canoodling in it. 
Q:  canoodling? 
A:  well, i can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y. 
Q:  i don't know. i mean, i guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so... 
A:  horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for? 
Q:  i guess you're right. 
A:  you guess i'm right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window. 
Q:  what are you doing? 
A:  emma was doing it! 
Q:  she's asleep. 
A:  ooh, she's asleep, that means we can... 
Q:  well, that was weird. you were loud, and i was fast. 
A:  i think we may have really done it this time. 
Q:  oh, i wish i didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test. 
A:  you may wanna get some more of those too.  
Q:  oh my god, where's emma? where's emma? 
A:  don't ask me, i was in there canoodling you! 
Q:  okay, okay, i'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell. 
A:  okay.  
Q:  don't you lie to me! i could tell by chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once? 
A:  all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating. 
Q:  hey! it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.  
A:  no, no, no. 
Q:  unless you name your firstborn child joey. 
A:  what? why? 
Q:  hey, i may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name. 
A:  your family name is tribbiani. 
Q:  what's your news? 
A:  thank you. i got a job in advertising.  
Q:   gosh, what's the pay like?  oh, come on people  come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most!  Hey Joey!  
A:  actually, it pays nothing. it's an internship. 
Q:  oh, that's cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'. 
A:  right. so, it'll be the same except less sex with you.  
Q:  so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? 
A:  well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like. 
Q:   that's great. 
A:  yeah, i mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  
Q:  chandler's new workplace, his fellow interns are already seated around a table] 
A:   good morning, everybody. 
Q:  can i get you a cup of coffee, sir? 
A:  oh, no, no, i'm an intern, just like you guys except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that I can rent a car. 
Q:  seriously, you're an intern? 
A:  yeah, well, i'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom. 
Q:   dude! 
A:  right. look, i know i'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like i'm bob hope   
Q:  so far so good!  
A:   honey, i'm old! 
Q:   what's wrong? 
A:  i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them. 
Q:  so you're a little older. try to look at the positive you have all this life experience. 
A:  yes, but i don't think life experience with these.  
Q:  what are they?  
A:  they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these. 
Q:   i give you $ 500 for them! 
A:  what am i supposed to do with these? 
Q:  ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time. 
A:  well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and i think i heard somebody say "slorps".  and here, look they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!  would you help me try to sell these? 
Q:  okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? 
A:  no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  what are you doing? 
A:  putting on the sneakers thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything 
Q:  oh, anything yet? 
A:  yes, how's this they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!  
Q:  we gotta get more of that.  
A:   you know what these aren't half-bad!  You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren. 
Q:  okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph. 
A:  alright  i feel youger already!  
Q:   that's interesting! just one thought you didn't mention the shoes. who's next?  chander 
A:  okay  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age 
Q:   your age? 
A:  a-huh. so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls 
Q:  chandler, that's great! 
A:  oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me  
Q:  you see? that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic, it's .  You did you come up with that? 
A:   i don't know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow. 
Q:  see all of you tomorrow.   
A:  the cold weather hurts my hip! 
Q:  i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money? 
A:  i'm not sure what they did, but i'm inclined to blame enron. 
Q:  i guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in. 
A:  maybe i should quit and get a job that pays. 
Q:  oh, but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold. 
A:  you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer? 
Q:  ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents. 
A:  no! we're not borrowing money. 
Q:  why not? 
A:  because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money. 
Q:  wow! i had no idea you had this much pride. 
A:  that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard. Opening Credits 
Q:  well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"  
A:  yeah.... she's not so cute. 
Q:  we don't do that! tell her we don't do that! 
A:  yes dear. 
Q:  central perk. chandler sits on the couch. joey sits at the round table] 
A:  hey joe! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything about it. 
Q:  i thought you didn't have secrets from monica. 
A:  and that would have made the official party line.  monica and I are having a little financial trouble. 
Q:  yeah, i know. 
A:  what? what do you mean you know? 
Q:  err... i just figured it out! you know, i mean you're not working and the economy is bad. 
A:  oh! right. 
Q:   that's the fastest i have ever thought! 
A:  anyway, err... i need to borrow some money. 
Q:  oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars? 
A:  yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that!  
Q:  err...well i...know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is.  
A:  oh ok. 
Q:  err... kind of. 
A:  i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems? 
Q:  oh no no no no no... it wasn't... it wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her. 
A:  what? 
Q:  something personal. 
A:  what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?  
Q:  thanks.....  
A:  hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife. 
Q:  thank you? 
A:  oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things. 
Q:  ok, you're being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something bad? 
A:  no no! i just love the way you look, i am warm, for your form. 
Q:  ok..you know the old classics you know,you look nice? they're still ok. 
A:  well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger. 
Q:  okay... 
A:  i mean, you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.  
Q:  chandler and monica's apartment. chandler enters. rachel and monica are seated at the table.] 
A:  hey rach! ah........ perfection.  wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing. 
Q:  honey? 
A:  yeah? 
Q:  about that? erm...i'm going to change. 
A:  but honey you don't have to. 
Q:  i'm going to get bigger! 
A:  honey i... i love your breasts the way they are! 
Q:  well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too. 
A:  your ass?!?!? 
Q:  man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too! 
A:  they...do that? 
Q:  it's kind of a package deal! 
A:  god why why would you want to do that to yourself!? 
Q:  i thought i was something that we both wanted! 
A:  alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet? 
Q:  oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!? 
A:   what? 
Q:  hey hey, can i help? 
A:  well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky. 
Q:  someday. 
A:  aaaaand....... hernia. 
Q:  we're all sorry...  
A:  ah, look on the bright side, i mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.  Ending Credits 
Q:  ross' apartment , chandler and joey enter] 
A:  hey! ready to go? 
Q:  hey ross, check this out!  yeah, i can't do that! 
A:  what are you doin'? 
Q:  have you seen this? it's a new alumni website for college! it's cool! you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to. 
A:  great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless . 
Q:  it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich? 
A:  the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you? 
Q:  uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... 
A:  bet she'd sleep with you now... 
Q:  no... i already e-mailed her. 
A:  let me see what you wrote about yourself "doctor paleontology, two kids... "  you split with carol because you have different interests?... i think you split with carol because you've one very similar interest! 
Q:   what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??  
A:  maybe we finish this for him!  "also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she's now my girlfriend. i don't care what society says. it's the best sex i've ever had"... aaand send! 
Q:  breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike! 
A:  oh, i'm so sorry! 
Q:  oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can't think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!!  hey monica, i really need your help getting through this... 
A:  you're not gonna need my help? 
Q:  well no, when i get to the point where... you know... i'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... i'm gonna come to you. 
A:  oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just thought of a fourth  
Q:   i have sex with dinosaurs?? 
A:  i believe i read that somewhere! 
Q:  that only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ok? depending on the species i'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!! 
A:  i respectfully disagree. 
Q:  i can't believe you put that on my alumni page! 
A:  who cares? nobody reads those things 
Q:  you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today. 
A:  i don't have a page. 
Q:  alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  "gay as the day is long"? 
A:  because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs. 
Q:  but that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true.  
A:  would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day. 
Q:   hello? no, he's not here. yeah, this is his wife. yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. i guess i should have known. yeah, i mean, he just kept making me watch moulin rouge. 
A:  hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie!  i'm so gonna get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go . 
Q:  what are you doing? 
A:  oh, you'll see my friend.  
Q:   i'm dead? 
A:   and so young. 
Q:  posting that i died? that really isn't funny. 
A:  well, how you died was funny. 
Q:  oh please, hit by a blimp? 
A:  it kills over one americans every year. 
Q:  unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think i'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. you're messing with people's feelings here. 
A:  you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west! 
Q:  ross's apartment ross is doing something on his laptop when chandler walks in] 
A:  hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me? 
Q:  uhu uhu, check this out.  
A:  huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out are ya? 
Q:  eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little "ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead.  oh my god! nobody cares that i'm dead!? 
A:  no, come on, you know that's not true. 
Q:  what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead! 
A:  well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community. 
Q:  i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy!  
A:  alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief. 
Q:  you're right. there isn't a decent outlet. 
A:  right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come. 
Q:  exactly!!  
A:  ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? you're having a memorial service for yourself!? 
Q:  no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me! 
A:  ross, don't press send, don't press se... ! 
Q:  it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!  
A:  there you go! someone came! 
Q:  hi, glad you could come. 
A:   please, come in. 
Q:  hi, you're chandler bing, right? i'm tom gordon, i was in your class. 
A:  oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat. 
Q:  thanks... uh... i'm so sorry about ross, it's... 
A:  at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps  
Q:  who is he? 
A:  some guy, tom gordon. 
Q:  what? you... you... oh! can i ask you a personal question? ho-how do you shave your beard so close? 
A:   ok tommy, that's enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!!  
Q:   hey, listen. call me. 
A:  ok!  
Q:  i look like a man?? 
A:  please, one ridiculous problem at a time! 
Q:  it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here! 
A:  you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand! 
Q:  yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone? 
A:  oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something? 
Q:   yeah...  Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler! 
A:  i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide.   
Q:  hi. i'm here for ross geller's memorial service. 
A:  kori? kori weston? 
Q:  yeah... 
A:  wow! you look amazing! 
Q:  and you are... 
A:  chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all. 
Q:  you are married though. 
A:  don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!  
Q:  i can't believe that ross is gone. it is just so sad. 
A:  i didn't know ross and you were so close. 
Q:  we weren't but we had one class together. he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. i always remembered him. 
A:  i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently. 
Q:  yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars. 
A:  yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you! 
Q:  Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart. 
A:  still on amelia earhart? 
Q:  no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times. 
A:  yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times. 
Q:  seriously you guys, i can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki. 
A:  i'll ask.  Boohaki? 
Q:  well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what I'm saying. 
A:  kinda like joey. 
Q:  god! look at all these tickets! it's so exciting! you know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade. 
A:  pie eating contest? 
Q:  oh! you assume because i was heavy that's the only way I could win something? 
A:  no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries. 
Q:  yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!  
A:  don't touch the phone! i'll get it, i'll get it, I'll get it!!  
Q:  think he washed his hands? 
A:  hello? hey charlie, what do you know? 
Q:  look who's coming around! 
A:  damnit. alright call me when you know more. 
Q:  did you get it? 
A:  one of the slots got filled. 
Q:  by you!? 
A:  sense the tone! no that kid nate got it. 
Q:  oh! i hate that guy! i mean come on kid! pull up your pants! 
A:  yeah i know. 
Q:  well, there's two spots left right? 
A:  yeah...i mean i want this so much! i mean, i wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.  
Q:  ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that. 
A:  i can see the headline now "lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm". 
Q:  why would i eat my own arm? 
A:  well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want. 
Q:  get a room! 
A:  ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win? 
Q:  i don't know, probably just invest it. 
A:  ooh! calm down ... 
Q:   you would do that? i never get picked! 
A:  you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go. 
Q:  you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're taking this away from me! 
A:  you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds. 
Q:   uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?  
A:   i'll take this one too  uh ... Mommy? 
Q:   well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no I can't.  
A:  hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.  
Q:  dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right? 
A:  well no, charlie's gonna get that. 
Q:  hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job! 
A:  he's the boss's son. 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  what about the ones you have on the nightstand? 
Q:  there are no tickets on the nightstand! 
A:  yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago.  
Q:  un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken! 
A:  honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand! 
Q:  chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong? 
A:   she's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ... 
Q:  ahhh!  
A:  let me finish ...  however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!  
Q:  hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!  
A:  oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery! 
Q:  don't come any closer! 
A:  can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished... 
Q:  as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish. 
A:   hey, there's two messages. These could be from work! 
Q:  oh, play them! 
A:  ok, here we go!  
Q:  "hey chandler, it's charlie" 
A:  this is..shhh! 
Q:  oh, it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work. 
A:  oh, is she related to ralph lauren? 
Q:   honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job. 
A:  yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right? 
Q:  "here we are, the official powerball numbers! we have 53" 
A:  i got that! 
Q:   damnit! anybody got anything? 
A:  no. 
Q:   hello? hold on. it's your boss. 
A:  ah, the "i'm sorry i rejected you" phone call. i'm not used to getting it from guys.  Hey, Steve. 
Q:  chandler, hi! i'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant. 
A:  oh no no no no, i'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks! 
Q:  chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter. 
A:  me, that guy who just said butt cracks? 
Q:  yes, that's right. we're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job. 
A:  ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. i'll see you tomorrow .  
Q:  oh sweetie, i'm so proud of you! 
A:  does that mean i get the good loving tonight? 
Q:   hey, that is so great about the job. 
A:  thanks, man. 
Q:  and i like to think i had a little something to do with it. 
A:  really? what? 
Q:  well, before, with the wishbone... i didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job. 
A:   oh yeah?  Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out. 
Q:  i know that, but look, we've got the powerball number, we've won 3 dollars! 
A:  wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout. 
Q:  you know what? you can have mine. 
A:  me too. 
Q:  oh no!you guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years! 
A:  what? no, i'm taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont ! 
Q:  oh, good!ok, good for you!try to recapture the magic! 
A:  so, what do you say? can you get out of work? 
Q:  oh, honey!i can't. i was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant! 
A:  are you really that busy? 
Q:  yeah, i'm sorry. i really am. 
A:  oh, that's ok.i'll just try and reschedule.  "hi, this is chandler bing. i made a reservation there and i need to change it  oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? can i just come some other time?  oh, can't you make an exception?" 
Q:  and tell them that in 2 weeks i will once again be a masseuse in good standing! 
A:   "look, this is ridiculous! i'm not paying for that room! ok?"  "oh, thank you very much!"  yeah, i'm going to vermont... 
Q:  oh, don't worry about it! just use your travel insurance. 
A:  i don't have travel insurance. 
Q:  hall of the romantic inn in vermont] 
A:  hi, chandler bing, i have a reservation. 
Q:  welcome to the chestnut inn mr. bing, so where are you joining from? 
A:  new york. 
Q:   the big apple! 
A:  i'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here. 
Q:  i am sorry mr. bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer. 
A:  well, that's impossible, can you check again, please? 
Q:  not there. 
A:  let me get this straight. i called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and i was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation? 
Q:   she doesn't know what to say! 
A:  just give us the cheapest room you have. 
Q:  unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars. 
A:  that's insane! 
Q:  totally insane. dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves. 
A:  does that room have a closet i can lock him in?  we'll take it. 
Q:  great. 
A:   what!? they are totally ripping us off! 
Q:  dude, don't worry 'bout it! i know how we can make your money back! this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! like those apples. instead of taking one, i'm... i take six! 
A:  great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there! 
Q:  c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time! 
A:  dude, you're shaking! 
Q:  what did you get? 
A:  usa today 
Q:  nice, put it with the others. 
A:  and i also got... two more apples. 
Q:  we are four short of a bush-o . god i feel so alive, i love being in the country! 
A:  i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. 
Q:  no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. for example hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt  i wish i'd thought this through. 
A:  i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that. 
Q:  not my first time in a hotel, my friend. 
A:  ok, how about this ? 
Q:  no, no, no, you can't take the remote control! 
A:  yes, but the batteries... 
Q:  let's celebrate with some maple candy! 
A:  no! 
Q:  here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay. 
A:  oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. 
Q:  oh my god. 
A:  what? 
Q:  there's something new in the bowl. 
A:  look, we have enough, just walk away. 
Q:  no, but i want...i want the pinecones! 
A:  there's a forest right outside. 
Q:  it's not the same. 
A:  ok, go quick! 
Q:  monica and chandler's apartement, monica is at the kitchen table writing something and chandler enters kitchen area] 
A:  i got you something from vermont!  
Q:   hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night? 
A:   well, let me see... i-i believe i'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv. 
Q:  look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play. 
A:  i could fall asleep at a play. 
Q:  i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day, so i can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want. 
A:   uh, let's see, who do i hate? 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey, you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today. 
A:  yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs. 
Q:   is he gonna introduce us? 
A:   no, i think we're just blurry shapes to him now. 
Q:  the theater. chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously] 
A:  where the hell is everybody? 
Q:  well, i bet you are all thinkin' "now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh? 
A:   oh yes, god yes!! 
Q:   well, you're not gonna get one! because in life there are no intermissions, people. chapter 7 divorce is a 4 letter word.  how could he leave me?!?! 
A:  i... i don't know... you seem lovely. 
Q:  oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry. 
A:  well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater. 
Q:  you really liked it? 
A:  oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why wouldn't i, because as a man i've been trained  not to listen!  but after chapter 16 "fat, single and ready to mingle", i was uplifted. 
Q:  oh really! 
A:  oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period! 
Q:  no! 
A:  did somebody sign your bra? 
Q:  hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler. 
A:  oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you. 
Q:  why don't you like me! chapter one my first period. 
A:  can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death . 
Q:  hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise! 
A:  i missed most of the party  charlie's a girl, right? 
Q:  ok.  
A:   so, a professor, uh? 
Q:   hey honey! i missed you today! 
A:  oh, yeah? 
Q:  yeah.  what d'you wanna do tonight? 
A:  oh, well... maybe we could...  
Q:  ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank. 
A:  we really need to take those tests? 
Q:  honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests. 
A:  but i don't wanna do it in a cup! 
Q:  what is the big deal? 
A:  it's weird! in a doctor's office? 
Q:  it's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell? 
A:   i cannot believe ross told you that!  And in my defense, it was a Wendy's! 
Q:  look, i don't wanna do this test either, but i really do think it's a good idea! 
A:  yeah, ok. i'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory! 
Q:   oh! 
A:  oh, yeah! rachel talks too! 
Q:  doctor's waiting room] 
A:  i have a weird feeling about this place.  how do i know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet. 
Q:  mr. bing?  here you are! you'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container. 
A:  deposit my specimen? you know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it. 
Q:  hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok? 
A:  yeah, i guess! 
Q:  oh my god!! 
A:  oh, come on! Commercial Break 
Q:  hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home! 
A:  why are you here? 
Q:  well, sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we... 
A:   no no no... i mean, why? why is she here?? 
Q:  oh! someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size . 
A:  what!?  
Q:  this was fun! but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!  
A:  i'd love to stay, but i have eh...  got a hot date...  
Q:  please... go!  just let me know if you need a hand! 
A:   i think it just fell off.  
Q:  the fertility clinic; chandler walks out one of the rooms] 
A:   my specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along!  Janice! You're not... gone? 
Q:  oh! sid is still in his room. i don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit? 
A:  yeah! yeah... the hard part is over! 
Q:  that's not the hard part honey! the hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results? 
A:  i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok. 
Q:  oh! well, you know what? it probably is. 
A:   yeah, but what if it's not? what if there is a reason why we can't have a baby? 
Q:  oh, chandler, look. you and monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine. 
A:   oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'... 
Q:  what, you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office? 
A:   it was a "wendy's!! " 
Q:  monica and chandler's. chandler is sitting on the sofa, reading the newspaper.] 
A:   It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.  
Q:  hey sweetie. 
A:  doctor connelly just called. 
Q:  with good news?  of course it is not good news, you just said  "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said  "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you? 
A:  actually it's both of us. 
Q:  what? 
A:  apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment. 
Q:  oh... what does that mean? 
A:  it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means... 
Q:  chandler? 
A:   it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us. 
Q:   oh my god! 
A:  i'm sorry. 
Q:  i'm sorry too.  
A:  well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out. 
Q:  doctor connelly's office] 
A:   wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face! 
Q:  oh, i so can't believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess! 
A:  oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!! 
Q:   hi there. 
A:  hi. 
Q:  above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! so, keep having sex on a regular basis. 
A:  oh, damn it!  
Q:  and, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt. 
A:  is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  wow, talking about an inhospitable environment! 
Q:  tsz... no! . 
A:   hey guys! 
Q:  wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me. 
A:  i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick. 
Q:  it's in barbados. 
A:  but you come first! 
Q:  bye, see ya.  
A:   ok. 
Q:  all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic? 
A:  not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample. 
Q:  so-so what did the doctor say? 
A:  well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her. 
Q:  so you're ruling out surrogacy? 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  so, i don't have to learn what that means? 
A:  aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors. 
Q:  enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs? 
A:   ah-ha! 
Q:  how do you feel about all this? 
A:  i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one. 
Q:  hi honey! 
A:  hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work! 
Q:   you too. 
A:  you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite!  go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer. 
Q:  thanks. 
A:   so, zack's pretty nice, uh? 
Q:  yeah, i guess. 
A:  so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his! 
Q:   excuse me? 
A:  well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is "spermtastic"! 
Q:  chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! "come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm"! 
A:  no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out. 
Q:  chandler! 
A:  i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go! 
Q:  i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor! 
A:  ok! 
Q:  uh! 
A:   zack! 
Q:  oh! i'm gonna go wash up first.  thanks! 
A:  so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones! 
Q:  ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!! 
A:  you don't like him. 
Q:  i think he is fine! it's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information. 
A:  alright! just follow my lead!  
Q:  you guys have such a great place here. 
A:  oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family? 
Q:  uhm... no. although i did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis. 
A:   that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack. 
Q:  ok. i heard a joke today. it's pretty funny... 
A:  you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness  
Q:  ravioli's delicious! 
A:  i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child? 
Q:  yess!!  
A:   we're teeth people zack! 
Q:  i'm gonna take off now. you're gonna let me go home, aren't you? 
A:  you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer? 
Q:  no, no, i should get home, i'm kinda tired. 
A:  are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression. 
Q:  no it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. i'll see you tomorrow. 
A:  ok.  
Q:  does seem pretty perfect. 
A:  yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him? 
Q:   no. 
A:  why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway! 
Q:  no, that's not it. it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you. 
A:  yeah, he's better! 
Q:  no, he's not. and if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else. 
A:  really? are you sure? 
Q:  yeah, i'm sure. 
A:   thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm. 
Q:  that is so sweet. i love you.  
A:  so you know this leaves us with... 
Q:  adoption. 
A:  how do you feel about that? 
Q:  i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it. 
A:  me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way. 
Q:  so this is it, we're really gonna adopt? 
A:   yeah. 
Q:   oh my god, we're gonna be parents! 
A:  we are gonna be great parents. 
Q:  and it could be soon. i mean, think about it right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived. 
A:  wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!  
Q:  zack's office] 
A:  hey, zack! 
Q:   hey chandler. 
A:  look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable. 
Q:  no you didn't. 
A:  really? 
Q:  no you did. 
A:  my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it.  
Q:  oh, thank you.  
A:  you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya? End 
Q:  do you have anything that would... get us out of them? 
A:  yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff". 
Q:   see? 
A:  yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind". 
Q:  really, it doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time! 
A:   she does? 
Q:   well, phoebe's still pretty hung up on that mike, uh? 
A:  i wouldn't read too much into it. 
Q:  still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right? 
A:  david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee. 
Q:  sorry, i just... i wish there was something i could do, you know? well, you know phoebe... 
A:  seriously, we're gonna do this? 
Q:  i'm sorry, uh... i just wish i could make her forget about mike already, you know... why did phoebe and mike break up? 
A:  oh, because his penis was too big.  oh, i'm sorry, that's the kind of thing i do.  they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage? 
Q:  that's great! that's great! i-i'll propose to her! 
A:  what? 
Q:  well, i was probably going to do it at some point. 
A:  i didn't mean now... 
Q:  why not? it's brilliant!  goodbye mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!  well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...  thank you, chandler. sincerely. 
A:  well, you're welcome! glad i could help. 
Q:   how do you think i should propose? 
A:  david, i'm pretending to read here!! 
Q:  wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david. 
A:   i do! want a hint? huh? "i do"  "i do". 
Q:  ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. 
A:  david is going to propose to phoebe. 
Q:  what?  why? 
A:  be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married. 
Q:  chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke? 
A:  i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said? 
Q:  they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say "no", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again. 
A:  man, that's some bad advice! 
Q:  ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?! 
A:  that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross! 
Q:  so, ehm... i'm proposing to pheobe tonight.  
A:  tonight?!  isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  oh, there it is! 
Q:  yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. that's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. and the clarity is uhm... is quite poor. 
A:   nice!  
Q:  ok! 
A:  david is going to propose to phoebe tonight! 
Q:  see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to? 
A:  that would be advice!! 
Q:  ross just read me his speech. it's fantastic! 
A:  oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...? 
Q:  if you want to check your email, just ask!  
A:   what?  may i? 
Q:  it's not the time charlie. 
A:   oh, no, no, no dear god, no! 
Q:  oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  oh! secret teapot? 
A:  your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone! 
Q:  wha... what do you mean?  
A:  it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive. 
Q:  what, oh my god. what did you do? 
A:  someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it. 
Q:  why, why would you open it? 
A:  well, it didn't say "this is a virus"!! 
Q:  what did it say? 
A:  nude... ... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry. 
Q:  what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler! 
A:  it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right? 
Q:  no! i don't!! 
A:  well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...! 
Q:  yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career! 
A:  i just feel awful. 
Q:  yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament! 
A:  well, i tried billy jean king, but...  you know, you and monica have the same "i'm gonna kill you" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her...  
Q:   well, i hope you're happy! 
A:   oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey! 
Q:  phoebe is going to say "yes" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives! 
A:  phoebe is going to say "yes"? that's, that's great! 
Q:  no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike! 
A:  and there's not chance that will work? 
Q:  no, i called him. it's not gonna happen. 
A:   oooooooh! meddler! meddler! 
Q:  well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place! 
A:  this vacation sucks!! 
Q:  i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike. 
A:  you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.  
Q:  oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go. 
A:  i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk?  "uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..." spit it out, david! 
Q:  i have a ring. 
A:  i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy. 
Q:  monica and chandler's room. monica and chandler are in bed.] 
A:  oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day. 
Q:   open your drapes! open your drapes! 
A:  i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!  
Q:  the sun is out! 
A:  hey! remember when i had corneas? 
Q:  ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion. 
A:  ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes. 
Q:  finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus... 
A:   not to mention the cold sores.  
Q:  and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.  
A:   really? 
Q:   ping pong?  honey, they have ping pong! let's play! 
A:  i don't think so! 
Q:   why not? 
A:  because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying! 
Q:  i'm not always that bad! 
A:  oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time? 
Q:   i punched you...? 
A:  and...? 
Q:  so, we're just four losers... super! 
A:  i'm not playing with you. 
Q:  mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing! 
A:  she gets crazy! this scar  is from pictionary!  
Q:  oh, by the way... i'm awesome!! 
A:   oh dear god, there's two of them! 
Q:  hell, yeah! 
A:   did you know this about him? 
Q:   one thousand... 
A:   ok! 
Q:   no...  either of you girls got a quarter? 
A:  honey, try to focus the trash talk on him! 
Q:  ah yeaaaah! 
A:   do you really find this attractive on him? 
Q:   oh, yeah!  are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?  
A:  i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one. 
Q:  and that's how it's done!  
A:  okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner. 
Q:  that's what i'm thinking. 
A:  should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil? 
Q:  ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41. 
A:   ok, look! enough is enough! 
Q:  no, i have just to have two more points to beat him! 
A:  monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head! 
Q:  i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours! 
A:  but... 
Q:  look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness! 
A:  what about the obsessive cleaning? 
Q:   aww!  
A:  you ok? 
Q:  i can't believe it!  i lost! 
A:  no, you didn't. 
Q:  what? 
A:  because i'm gonna play for ya. 
Q:   honey, you don't have to do this. 
A:   yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you. 
Q:  but... you suck! 
A:   you're welcome, sweetheart.  
Q:  it's like watching porn!  
A:  and that's... how... it's done! 
Q:   oh my god. that was so amazing! when did you  hold on! i almost forgot  loser!  when did you stop sucking? 
A:  i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was! 
Q:  why? 
A:  i don't know. 
Q:  this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments! 
A:  that's why! 
Q:  i'll put a pillowcase over my head. 
A:  you're on!  
Q:  sounds like he's with someone. 
A:  he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps. 
Q:  oh my god, that's charlie! 
A:  she's cheating on joey with ross! 
Q:  ooh... 
A:  wow! 
Q:  i can't believe this. rachel and joey? 
A:  how about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall! 
Q:  i'm on it! 
A:  anything? 
Q:  bedsprings, unmistakable! 
A:  you do realise that's your brother? 
Q:  not until you said it. somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with. 
A:  that's not true. i came with monica and i'm leaving with Weird Al. 
Q:  okay, i've had it with the hair jokes. tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon. 
A:  okay buckwheat! 
Q:  that's the door. he's gone... 
A:  and she's... turning on the tv... and watching... Miss Congeniality! 
Q:   yeah, we had a great time, thank you!  
A:   bye! 
Q:  okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere? 
A:  he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...  
Q:  well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him? 
A:  you got it! 
Q:  all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it... 
A:  okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you? 
Q:  sure... 
A:  enunciate! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  you guys ready to go? 
A:  not quite. monica's still at the salon, and i'm just finishing packing. 
Q:  dude! you're not taking your bible? 
A:  you're not supposed to take that. besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it? 
Q:  who's day just got better? chandler!  
A:  hey!... aaaaaahhhh! 
Q:  what do you think? 
A:  i think.... i think i can see your scalp. 
Q:  and listen to this...  
A:  what d'ya know... it's a treat for the eyes and the ears. 
Q:  whoo, whoo. wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that i'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up. 
A:  yeah, it's almost if air barbados doesn't care about your social life. 
Q:  no, i'll do it.  
A:  wish i could switch with someone. i really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.  
Q:  oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  Ow! 
A:  you go back to work tomorrow night, right? 
Q:  yeah! 
A:  so if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn? 
Q:  well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be able to do this.  You like that, right?  
A:  what are you singing? 
Q:  it's "bolero" from "10". 
A:  it's "ride of the valkyries" from "apocalypse Now"... 
Q:  you what? you said you liked them. 
A:  did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was that I could see your scalp. 
Q:  fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does. 
A:  again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different. 
Q:  you know what? i don't care. i like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  OUCH! 
A:  hit yourself in the tooth? 
Q:  chandler and monica's. only chandler is in the living room and walks to the bathroom.] 
A:  honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay? 
Q:  i have a problem. 
A:  really? what happened? 
Q:  well, i was dancing around, and singing "no woman, No Cry" and I got stuck. 
A:  you can't move at all? 
Q:  oh, well, i can move...  
A:  if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose? 
Q:   i guess so... 
A:   some of these look a little frayed. 
Q:  look what i found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this... 
A:  now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me? 
Q:  sure, what do you have in mind? 
A:  i think you know. 
Q:  really? i don't really feel like it. 
A:  this is what i want to do. 
Q:  okay, i just don't get why you like it so much. 
A:   she's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant. THE END 
Q:  god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives. 
A:  there's a hair in my coffee.  
Q:  hey, have you seen frank jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets. 
A:  you know, it's funny. every time you say "triplets," i immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.  
Q:  we went through the same thing when we were adopting. 
A:  so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?  
Q:  i know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us. 
A:  that's great.  can i see the book?  
Q:  can i adopt you?  
A:  hey, you must be owen. 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too. 
Q:  you were? 
A:  yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother. 
Q:  huh? 
A:  you know how to use a compass? 
Q:  i have a badge in it. 
A:  you do? that's fantastic! 
Q:  you wanna see it? 
A:  i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you. 
Q:  what?!? 
A:  what? 
Q:  i'm adopted?  
A:  i got nothing. 
Q:  bill and colleen's apartment. chandler comes running into the living room. Monica is the only one there.] 
A:  where are bill and colleen? 
Q:  they're in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you believe how nice they are? 
A:  we have to leave!! 
Q:  why? what did you do in the bathroom? 
A:  i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him. 
Q:  i'll go get him in a second. by the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet. 
A:  but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he already knows?  
Q:  i'm adopted?! 
A:  see? intuitive! 
Q:  he told me! and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell. 
A:  which technically now you should give back! 
Q:  you told him he's adopted? 
A:  i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real." 
Q:  uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. bill and colleen hate us. 
A:  owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him. 
Q:  still, he had to find out sometime. 
A:  yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?  
Q:  yeah. it's actually our first official date 
A:  wow! so tonight may be the night! you're nervous? 
Q:  naa, no. this is the part i'm actually good at. 
A:  what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing. 
Q:   it's ok! 
A:  how can you be so confident? 
Q:  well, i... i know exactly what i'm gonna do! 
A:  really? like you have a routine? 
Q:  no, no no no no. see. each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness. 
A:  really? 
Q:  no, i do six things! first, i look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh. 
A:  you mean like this?  
Q:  no! not like that, no no. no, like this.  
A:  oh, i see what you mean, that's quite nice.  
Q:  more foosball? 
A:  ...and beer!! OPENING CREDITS 
Q:   wow! 
A:  hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop staring at your sister's legs! 
Q:  i'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan? 
A:  she went on one of those spray-on tan places. 
Q:   why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators? 
A:   why...why? 
Q:  still, i can't believe that's sprayed on... i mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one! 
A:  sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off. 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey pheebs! 
Q:  i know, amanda! ah! she called me too! She's the worst! 
A:  who's amanda? 
Q:  she's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!" 
A:  are you trying to do a british accent? 
Q:    chandler gets pedicures! 
A:  just so i know, how many more of those can i expect? 
Q:  oh, i guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that? 
A:  no, had it done to me though. feels good ! 
Q:  ok, don’t hold thy breath!  
A:  hello? is someone on the line? 
Q:  yes, i was looking for monica. 
A:  hang on, she’s right here.  Someone's on the phone, for ya. 
Q:  we weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda! 
A:   i get pedicures! 
Q:  monica and chandler's apartment]  
A:  hold on! there is something different. 
Q:  i went to that tanning place your wife suggested. 
A:  was that place... the sun? 
Q:  oh! and it gets worse!  
A:  oh my god! you can do a duet of ebony and ivory all by yourself! 
Q:  oh oh! what is up with miss hawaiian tropic? 
A:  how was your date with joey? 
Q:  well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away! 
A:  you didn't like that? 
Q:   chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open! 
A:   you don't know!  
Q:  we are not friends with phoebe anymore. 
A:  if she asks, i protested a little, but ok!  
Q:  ooh, that accident must have been terrible. you look positively ghastly. 
A:  well, aren't you a treat. 
Q:  i don't know.  
A:  that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey! 
Q:  hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that? 
A:  kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys... 
Q:  yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong? 
A:  actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.  
Q:  ross's apartment.]  
A:  dude, it's chandler. let me in.  
Q:  go away! i don't want to see anybody. 
A:  i know, i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in. 
Q:  dude, you're not tanned. 
A:  no, i just had to get a picture of this.  
Q:  hey! 
A:  honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend. 
Q:  no, that day... that won't be her real birthday! 
A:  gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was! 
Q:  well, i'm sorry, but chandler and i could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally. 
A:  there's this thing i really want us to do. i read about it in maxim... 
Q:  all right, we'll stay. we can just drive up after the party. 
A:  fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party... 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey hey! where's the birthday girl? 
Q:  oh, she's still napping 
A:  oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening. 
Q:  i can't believe emma is still asleep! 
A:  i know, what are we gonna do? 
Q:  i've got a plan. i've got a plan. i'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up! 
A:  i'm not going to vermont with this monica! 
Q:   yes, yes. i still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts! 
A:  to be fair this one does have nuts.   
Q:  well, you know what? while we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok! 
A:  hi emma! it's the year 2020. are you still enjoying your nap? 
Q:  we're aunt monica and uncle chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years! 
A:  we used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.  
Q:   hello?  oh no! what happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.  
A:  was that emma? is she up? 
Q:  no, wait ! you guys, no, no, you can't leave! rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone? 
A:  i don't know! you'll tell us on monday! 
Q:  got it!  Hey hey hey!  Where do you think you're going? 
A:  to the bathroom! 
Q:  oh no! he's not getting away that easy!  
A:   what are you doing? get the hell out of here!  
Q:   oh! well that's it! he's the last one to go. i'm locking you guys in.  
A:  you do know, i can just turn them the other way around, right? 
Q:  or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the.. 
A:  i'm begging you stop. 
Q:   yeah!! let's do that! 
A:   that sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont! 
Q:  ok! i want the dolphin! 
A:  thats a bear. 
Q:  ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!  
A:  ok, on your mark... get set... go!!!  
Q:  wha... how the hell is that gonna help? 
A:  i bought you. how did i forget that that's all you do?  
Q:  no! no, no... wait! we didn't lose.  the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically... 
A:  they left.  
Q:  now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size. 
A:  i'm sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica? 
Q:  game? 
A:  emma, you even know it's your birthday today? you're one! one-year-old, that's little.  
Q:  that's how old you are. 
A:  did i teach her that? did i just... impart wisdom? 
Q:   ooh, i want one... 
A:  me too...  
Q:  ...and head to canada! 
A:  i was kidding. 
Q:  hey, are ross and rachel back? 
A:  no, not yet. 
Q:  i don't care that you left. i'm just glad that you're here. thanks you guys! 
A:  hey, guys! come on! you gotta see what emma just did. 
Q:  what? 
A:  emma, how old are you? how old are you today?  
Q:  okay, here we go! emma's first birthday cake... well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma. 
A:  let's do it, come on!  
Q:  of course, i'd be honored! 
A:  thanks! 
Q:  u-u-um, i think there's been an oversight. 
A:  joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested. 
Q:  thank you! alright, let me see how i'm gonna start... "dear baby adoption decider people..." 
A:  so excited about your letter!  
Q:  yeah! 
A:  so you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate? 
Q:  you guys do that? chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom! 
A:  that's where people make number two!! OPENING CREDITS 
Q:  hey, finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. 
A:   i don’t... uh... understand. 
Q:  of course it does! it’s smart! i used the the-saurus! 
A:  on every word? 
Q:  oh, ‘they are warm, nice, people with big hearts’. 
A:  and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...? 
Q:  well, because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself! 
A:  you know what? you don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump. 
Q:  hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever. 
A:  i doubt that! tell her about us last year. 
Q:  seriously? 
A:  word! 
Q:  yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this! 
A:  she's right! if i were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..? 
Q:  i proposed to chandler!  alright, moving on... 
A:  oh, i don't think it was desperate, i think it was amazing! 
Q:  yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two  like that? 
A:  sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  
Q:  central perk. joey is inside, chandler and monica walk in.] 
A:  hey joe! how's the second draft of the letter coming? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  can we read it? can you print out another copy? 
Q:  oh my god, oh my god, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds! 
A:  it's ok, it's ok. you know what?  i'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.  
Q:  okay good. 
A:   hello, this is chandler bing. somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. . 
Q:  ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? you know what? just tell me on the way to the bird store. 
A:   they loved it. 
Q:  what? 
A:  they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter. 
Q:   they thought joey was a child? 
A:  she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.  
Q:  ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. 
A:  that sounds like fun. 
Q:  well, if i had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it? 
A:  i think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong! 
Q:  because there are so many terrible sights in this world. 
A:  like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was in a milk carton but it looked like meat? 
Q:   o-okay! 
A:  hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects! 
Q:  dead.  oh, it's ok, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach. 
A:  hey, i'm sorry, i should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it. 
Q:  chandler and monica's apartment] 
A:   hey honey! 
Q:   Hi sweetie! 
A:  is monica not here? 
Q:  no. 
A:  oh, then i'll tell you. my agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial! 
Q:  cool! 
A:  yeah, and i don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine!  Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!! 
Q:  that's great! hey, can you cast me in it? 
A:  oh... i don't know, i really don't think you're right for the part. 
Q:  what do you mean? i can do anything, i'm a chameleon! Huh?  I'm old!  I'm tired!  Hey, I'm hot  I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do? 
A:  first of all. bravo. uh, but i really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor. 
Q:  i can do that!  "hello, i'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product? 
A:  software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions? 
Q:  central perk. rachel, joey and emma are there.] 
A:  hey you guys. 
Q:  oh! any word on casting yet? 
A:  joe, i told you, you're just not right for the part. 
Q:  look, c'mon, please? it's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor!  Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in. 
A:  joe... 
Q:  just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses! 
A:  fine! 
Q:  thank you.  
A:  work, joe! 
Q:  just pass it to your boss! 
A:  he's not right for the part. so if i suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own! 
Q:  just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys. 
A:  that's good! i liked it, they didn't.  Joey, for God's sake, go to work! . 
Q:  chandler walks into joey's apartment] 
A:  hey joe! 
Q:  what's up? 
A:  bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested. 
Q:   oh. 
A:   i'm sorry man. 
Q:   but, ehm... you watched the tape? 
A:   yeah! i... i... i liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches! 
Q:   you didn't watch the tape. 
A:   what!? of course i did! 
Q:  look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? 
A:  i'm not lying to you, i watched it! 
Q:  well, you lied again!  
A:  i watched it! 
Q:  keep going pinocchio! 
A:    i did! 
Q:   no you didn't!  
A:   i'm telling you, i watched the tape.  
Q:  did you watch the tape? 
A:  No! 
Q:  joey and rachel's apartment. chandler and rachel are talking.] 
A:  i can't believe joey. i hate being called a liar! 
Q:  but you are a liar. 
A:  what did i just say?  
Q:  you still here? 
A:  yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something... 
Q:  ok whoah-hey... let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying...   Stop lying! 
A:  why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape? 
Q:   and that's how i know you didn't watch the tape! .  
A:  he really is a chameleon. 
Q:  rachel and joey's. joey's home alone, reading a sports Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.] 
A:  look, i'm sorry i didn't give them your tape. and I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not. 
Q:  that's not the point chandler. the point is that you lied. 
A:  i know. you're right. what's it gonna take for you to forgive me? 
Q:  now, what do you say? 
A:  lying is wrong! 
Q:  and?... and? 
A:  i'm a pretty little girl. 
Q:  oh, figuring out our wedding plans. 
A:  that's funny, we were doing the same thing! 
Q:  it's really crazy! the hall, the dress, the food... i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was! 
A:  yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the numbers. 
Q:  so what did you two do about it? 
A:  it was pretty simple actually, i came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell. 
Q:  i've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture! 
A:   maybe you do that next time you get married! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  what's going on? 
A:  our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment. 
Q:   we? 
A:  you know you don't want me to help. you can't have it both ways! 
Q:  hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby? 
A:  kind of. she's coming by to interview us and see where we live. 
Q:  hey, maybe i should stop by! she could be a soap opera fan! it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity. 
A:   little people? 
Q:  ok, so i think i'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes? 
A:  what...? no! 
Q:  chandler? 
A:   i don't, and i'm offended by the insinuation! 
Q:  ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR? 
A:  i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine. 
Q:  oh my god, the adoption lady is early! 
A:  ok, ok, here we go. 
Q:  ok. 
A:  here we go. stand up straight.  big smile.  
Q:  yay! 
A:  but you already gave all your money to charity! 
Q:  well, i’ll just ask for it back! 
A:  i don’t think you can do that! 
Q:  why not! this is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids! 
A:  that’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady. 
Q:  ok. great. i am so glad that you are here. we’re really excited about getting this process started. 
A:  oh, because we love kids. love ‘em to death.well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law. 
Q:  is that that couple on the first floor? because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.  
A:  but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building. 
Q:  oh... 
A:  what? 
Q:  yes! 
A:  of course it was! 
Q:  yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't. 
A:  rat bastard! 
Q:  what was that? 
A:  oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. he's great with kids though. 
Q:  guys? everything ok? it's me, joe... 
A:   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......aaaaaa-doption!! 
Q:  what's going on? 
A:  oh, just like i said. that crazy... bert... roaming the halls.  
Q:  what's going on? 
A:  we'll talk to you later, bert. everythng's fine!!  
Q:  is he alright out there by himself? 
A:  oh yeah! he has a caretaker. his older brother... ernie. 
Q:  bert and ernie! 
A:   you can't make this stuff up! 
Q:   why don't i show you the baby's room?  
A:  what the hell are you doing? 
Q:  well, you wouldn't let me in, so i thought you were in trouble. 
A:  well, we're not. 
Q:  but you called me 'bert'!? that's our code word for danger! 
A:  we don't have a code word. 
Q:   what room should we see next? 
A:  any room that isn't behind this couch!  
Q:   i did not care for that! 
A:   you have to get out of here. you slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you. 
Q:  ok, ok!  
A:  ok!  
Q:  oh my god! 
A:  and for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! and we don't want to buy your bat!  
Q:  are you friends with him? 
A:  i can explain... joey... 
Q:   i'm sorry that you had to see that. i'm so embarrassed... 
A:  oh, that's really ok. 
Q:  hello...? oh hi... oh my god...! really...? i can't wait to tell chandler... Ok, goodbye.  
A:  wrong number? 
Q:  it was laura... she gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list. 
A:  that's great! 
Q:  now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...  
A:  hello...? have you seen joey's bat? COMMERCIAL BREAK 
Q:  we need to talk to you about something. 
A:  yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year. 
Q:  are you kidding? 
A:  well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. 
Q:   that doesn't sound like you... that's monica talking! 
A:  no, no! we made this decision together. 
Q:  that's my favourite kind! okay, we are doing this! 
A:  don't let yourself get manipulated this way! 
Q:  hey, stay out of this, chandler! this is between me... and me! 
A:  we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you? OPENING CREDITS 
Q:   did someone drop the baton again? 
A:  why come all the way from kansas to do that? 
Q:   i don't get older. i just get better! 
A:  you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon! 
Q:  you don't know that. 
A:  somebody is gonna pick us. 
Q:  yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks! 
A:  i'm telling ya! it's gonna happen. next year it's gonna be you, me and the little hemingway bing.  what, he's my favourite author! 
Q:  name one of his books. 
A:   "the firm"? 
Q:  ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready... 
A:  you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year. 
Q:  oh, chandler, that's sweet. but you don't have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do. 
A:  i'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile". 
Q:  ok, let's see... oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it. 
A:  tell me more. 
Q:  okay, i'm gonna go check on something across the hall. you start by washing these  not with soap!!  
A:  you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive potatoes!  
Q:  oh. 
A:  oh my god! 
Q:  did i do something to you? 
A:  hmm, the game's at one. 
Q:  so? 
A:  dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back. 
Q:  so we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time. 
A:  you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up. 
Q:  dude, two times that happened! 
A:  look, monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go! 
Q:  right, i guess. alright, so see you at four. 
A:  okay.  and get ready to taste my very special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries! 
Q:  where is everybody? they're forty-five minutes late! 
A:  i can't believe they are not here! i slave and i slave for what? they've ruined cranberry day! 
Q:  do you hear something?  
A:   they're out there! 
Q:  ohhh! let me see! oh god, i can't believe this! they're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking! 
A:   everything is so distorted! looks like joey has a giant hand! which says "rangers" on it. they went to the game! 
Q:   oooh! they are in for a world of pain! 
A:   ross' shirt is torn. 
Q:  no! everything's cold. the turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy. 
A:  yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce? 
Q:   nothing. it's fine. 
A:   oh thank god!  
Q:  come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? our subway broke down. 
A:   that's a lie, you went to the game, i can see joey's hand. 
Q:  hey, you touch that and you will be sorry. 
A:  guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger than i've ever seen it.    
Q:  that's worse than no food.   
A:  ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts! 
Q:  stinky?! 
A:  please let me stay on this side of the door.  
Q:  oh! it all looks so beautiful the turkey, the stuffing...  
A:  the cranberries...? 
Q:   hey listen guys, we feel really terrible. 
A:  he's doing that weird eye contact thing. don't look at him, don't look at him!  
Q:   now let's not ruin this day. you worked so hard. let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh? 
A:  the floating heads do make a good point. 
Q:  really girls, not cool. 
A:  well, you manheads aren't any better. you lied about going to the game. you knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway. 
Q:  fine! let's just go. i don't need your stupid dinner. 
A:  that would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling. 
Q:   aaw-ahhh-aaahhh stop! stop! i'm worried about damaging my head. 
A:  a little late for that. 
Q:  alright, well, this does not change anything.  okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face. 
A:  uhm, we've got turkey grease. 
Q:  well hurry, i can't feel my ears! 
A:  can you ever feel your ears? 
Q:  chandler, where are your tools? 
A:   oh, i left them on my bulldozer... i don't have tools! 
Q:  it's really starting to hurt. 
A:  okay, look, i'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? okay, so push! 
Q:  ooh! stop putting things down my pants! 
A:  come on guys, push! 
Q:  push! push! push!  
A:  my cranberries! 
Q:   man, i've got food all over me.  
A:  argh! i can't believe what you did. monica's gonna kill you!  
Q:   i don't care.  
A:  what's going on? 
Q:  that was the adoption agency... 
A:  and? 
Q:  we're getting a baby! 
A:  are you serious?  
Q:  sure. i went through the exact same thing with alicia mae emory... the waiting, the wandering... then one day... i get that call from toys "r" us... she was in stock! 
A:  that is the exact same thing. THE END 
Q:  central perk. everyone's sitting on the couch.monica and chandler enter] 
A:  Hi! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  we're just here to say goodbye, we're off to ohio. 
Q:  i can't believe it. when you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! that is so weird! 
A:  and so incorrect! 
Q:  come on, she's gonna love you guys! 
A:  uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up. 
Q:  and a lot could still get in our way. 
A:  yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.. 
Q:  what are you gonna name the baby? 
A:  i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word. 
Q:  oh my god. she's gonna pick us! 
A:  so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'? 
Q:  you know, i know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? if this works out, we're gonna have a baby chandler, a baby! 
A:  yes, but... 
Q:  oh my god, it's gonna work! we're gonna make it work! i'm gonna be a mummy and  you're gonna be a daddy! all right, i'll see you suckers. i'm gonna get me... a baby! {she leaves) 
A:  oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!! OPENING CREDITS 
Q:  ok, thank you. uh, well this is it. are you ok? 
A:  yeah. just weird, you know. it's like "hi, i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?" 
Q:  uh, we're gonna be great. 
A:  you're gonna be great. 
Q:   hi... 
A:  thank you so much for agreeing to see us. 
Q:  i'll let you get acquainted. 
A:  ok. 
Q:  so, it's monica and chandler. i only know you as file 0w33815-d. 
A:  that's what our friends call us. 
Q:  you're kidding me? i mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. but on top of it, you're married to a reverend? 
A:   i don't think that's exactly... 
Q:  the adoption agency in ohio. monica and chandler are still talking with erica.] 
A:  so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you? 
Q:  amen. 
A:  plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! 
Q:  wow. 
A:  yeah, wow. 
Q:   being a doctor must take up a lot of time. 
A:  no-ot for me it doesn’t.  
Q:  do you have any question for erica? 
A:  yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? 
Q:  yes, our system assures total anonimity. we’re very proud of it. 
A:  you should be. you’re really on top of stuff.. 
Q:  oh my god, this is great! this is so great! . did you hear that? 
A:  yeah, i did. 
Q:  monica and chandler's hotel room. they enter.] 
A:  we are not signing those papers. 
Q:  why not? 
A:  it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else. 
Q:  god works in mysterious ways. 
A:  you have gotta stop! 
Q:  but she liked us. 
A:  she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica. 
Q:  well, if you think about it, i am kind of like a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing the hungry and poor.  
A:  your veal chop is $34,95! 
Q:  c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now. 
A:  but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this? 
Q:   because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us. 
A:  i know.. 
Q:  i mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if no one ever picks us? 
A:  oh, honey.. 
Q:   please.. please, we are so close. 
A:  monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to. 
Q:   okay, right.  
A:  so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us. 
Q:   maybe she will. uh! why couldn't i have been a reverend? 
A:  you're jewish. 
Q:  hey. 
A:  hey. 
Q:  i don't understand. 
A:  the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor. 
Q:  that's impossible. 
A:  i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. 
Q:  so who are you? 
A:  well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york. 
Q:  i don't want to look at your file! this is over.  
A:  erica wait! 
Q:  i've nothing to say to you.  
A:  you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. 
Q:  why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? 
A:  erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising. 
Q:  oh yeah. i actually liked you guys. but it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.  
A:  but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please?  
Q:   sex! 
A:   seriously, answer faster! 
Q:  oh, i'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" i wasn't thinking about "sex with you"! 
A:   it's like a giant hug. 
Q:  oh yeah? well, let's see.  ok, duck down.  
A:   hello. 
Q:  oh, hi chandler. it's phoebe. uhm... i know that monica is working today so... ...i was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and rachel. 
A:  oh, uhm... i have to work too. yeah, i'm stuck at the office all day. 
Q:   oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "liar, liar" or "betrayal", or... "an affair to remember". 
A:  those are all really old! 
Q:  monica’s apartment. chandler enters the door.] 
A:  hi! 
Q:  hey! you smell like perfume and cigarettes. 
A:  i was in the car with nancy all day. 
Q:  nancy doesn’t smoke! 
A:  well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that! 
Q:  so? what do you think of the house? 
A:  it’s perfect. it’s everything we’ve been looking for. 
Q:  isn’t it? then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 
A:  and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  what were the things you said? 
Q:  don’t you love the huge yard? 
A:  and the fireplace in the bedroom. 
Q:  and nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents! 
A:  this is bringing out a lovely color in you! 
Q:  so? do you think we should get it? 
A:  i don’t know. what do you think? 
Q:  i think we should. 
A:  i do too. 
Q:  this is huge! 
A:  i know. 
Q:  how bad you wanna smoke, right now. 
A:  i don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day. 
Q:  gotcha. when do we tell them about this? 
A:  we don’t. not until it's a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing. 
Q:  okay. right. oh my god that is gonna be so hard. 
A:  i know. gooooood luck with it. 
Q:  yeah, sure... uhm, i'm devastated, obviously...  did you think the neighborhood was homey?  
A:  hey! 
Q:   you son of a bitch! 
A:  is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here? 
Q:   ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big. 
A:  yeah  i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor. 
Q:  and that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset... 
A:  ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by. 
Q:   it's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.  
A:  actually, we already found a house we love. 
Q:  and about an hour ago, we made an offer.  
A:  bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE 
Q:  wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers? 
A:  i know this is really hard and we're really sorry. 
Q:  is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food?  because i can stop doing that,  i really, really think i can! 
A:   you know that's not the reason joe.  
Q:  you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence? 
A:  hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'c'!  
Q:  oooohh that’s interesting. 
A:  if you win, we give up the birds. 
Q:   dah!!  
A:  but if we win, we get your apartment. 
Q:  correct. rachel claims this is her favorite movie… 
A:  dangerous liaisons. 
Q:  everyday use. 
A:  fancy. 
Q:  guest. 
A:  fancy guest. 
Q:  no, 19. 
A:  thanks man. 
Q:  don’t blame the questions! 
A:  would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!  
Q:  chandler!!! chandler!!!  chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window! chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister! now get out here! 
A:   wow! listen, we had a good run. you know, what was it? four? five months? i mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!  
Q:   hey, what's-what's going on?! 
A:  well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica. 
Q:   i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this! 
A:  look, we're not just messing around! i love her. okay, i'm in love with her. 
Q:  and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive.   you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!!  TIME LAPSE  
A:   hey. 
Q:  she really left. 
A:  i know.  
Q:  thank you. 
A:  no problem roomie.  
Q:  can i ask you a question? 
A:  sure! 
Q:  what the hell is that dog doing here?!   
A:  little toast here. i know this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked. 
Q:  and a crappy new year. 
A:  here, here! 
Q:  yeah. so don't move, okay? just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.  
A:  hello? it's nancy, they responded to our offer. 
Q:  and?  
A:   okay, thanks...  they passed. they said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price. 
Q:  we can't afford that. 
A:  i know. 
Q:  you know, i'm really sorry i wasn't more supportive before. 
A:  that's okay, we understand. 
Q:  i know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... i love that one so much. 
A:  yeah... well, it's a good thing we got it then. 
Q:  what? 
A:  we got the house. 
Q:  oh my god! 
A:  i just didn't want to tell you in front of them. 
Q:  oh my god! my god! we've got the house !? 
A:  we're getting the house.  we're getting the house. 
Q:  and a baby... 
A:  we're growing up. 
Q:  we sure are. 
A:  so who's gonna tell them? 
Q:   not it! 
A:  not it! damn it! COMMERCIAL BREAK 
Q:  aah! why? what are these for? 
A:  you'll see. 
Q:  seriously you guys, what's going on? what are these for? 
A:  well, i didn't know how to tell you before, but... we got the house. 
Q:  or "win, lose or draw". 
A:  what did i marry into? 
Q:  ross and i always wanted to be donny and marie. 
A:  you guys just keep getting cooler and cooler! 
Q:   "...and i'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"! 
A:   i'm leaving you. OPENING CREDITS 
Q:  so weird to see all these people again... oh my god, look, there's geoffrey cleric. 
A:  who? 
Q:  he was roommates with john rosoff. he went out with andrea tamburino. she dumped him for michael skloff. 
A:   did i go to this school? 
Q:  hey, there's missy goldberg. you gotta remember her. 
A:   sure, nice. 
Q:  dude. you're married to my sister. 
A:  you're right, by saying "nice" i'm virtually licking her. 
Q:  hey, i hear she's single again, d'you think i should ask her out? 
A:  are you asking permission to break the pact? 
Q:  hey. hey, check out the flyers for the band. i made 'em on a macintosh in the computer room! 
A:  awesome, the name really stands out. 
Q:  thanks to a little something called "helvetica bold 24 point"! 
A:  man, we're gonna rock that asian student union! 
Q:  hey guys! 
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey, missy... 
A:  you know, our band is playing on friday. 
Q:  right. i'll be there.  
A:  fresh! 
Q:  boss! 
A:  mint! 
Q:  she's gone. 
A:  i know it. you know, i'm totally gonna ask her out. 
Q:  dude, i was gonna ask her out. 
A:  i said it first, bro. 
Q:  well, i thought it first, holmes. 
A:   look, if you did... 
Q:  woha! wait... what are we doing? what we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. i mean, we can get laid anytime we want. 
A:  totally. i had sex in high school... 
Q:  me too. i'm good at it. 
A:  all right, i'd say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg. 
Q:  you got it. 
A:  all right, so that's missy goldberg, phoebe cates and molly ringwald, who neither of us can go out with. 
Q:  those are the pacts! 
A:  oh, and sheena easton. but we probably couldn't get her anyway. 
Q:  oh, oh... maybe not you!  
A:  well, i officially give you permission to break the pact. 
Q:  thank you.  all right, here i go. hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college? 
A:  your hands are shaking. 
Q:   you made out with missy goldberg. how could you do that, after you promised me?  
A:   excuse me. . that didn't make us sound gay at all! 
Q:  you broke the pact! 
A:  ross, that was 16 years ago! 
Q:  that doesn't matter! we're talking about the foundation of our friendship. 
A:  i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  all right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts. 
Q:  i didn't. 
A:  oh really? 
Q:  no. 
A:  oh really!? 
Q:  no! 
A:  adrienne turner!!  
Q:  i never did anything with adrienne turner. 
A:  oh please, and you knew how much i liked her. 
Q:  i don't know what... you're talking about. 
A:  really? 
Q:  well lets see. maybe he knows where ross is.  hey, how's it going . 
A:  aren't you...? 
Q:  yeah, rachel. and this  is ross' sister, monica. we met at thanksgiving. . 
A:   right.  so how're you doing? 
Q:  bitchin' 
A:  hi monica. 
Q:  hi chandler. it's really nice to see you  not.  
A:  o-kay. i'll see if i can find ross.  
Q:  i didn't know you knew about that. 
A:  well, i did and it hurt.  that's when i wrote the song "betrayal in the common room". 
Q:   man... i... i'm sorry. 
A:  look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago. 
Q:  so, eh. i made out with adrienne and you made out with missy. well i guess we're even. 
A:   hmm mmmhm.. 
Q:  we are even, right? 
A:   just one more thing. i was so pissed at you that night that i wanted to get back at you. so i thought, who does ross like the more than anybody? 
Q:   what did you do to my mom? 
A:  not her! 
Q:  that's weird. i've had the same number of beers as you and i don't feel anything at all.  
A:  soo... you girls having fun? 
Q:   i am soo not going to do good on my sats tomorrow. 
A:  well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out. 
Q:   oh yeah. there is a plan! why don't i just start taking my smart pills now? 
A:  well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship. 
Q:   oh, what a line.  
A:  so where are you applying to? 
Q:  oh well, you know, i think it's kinda really important that i go somewhere where there's sun, so i'm sort of...   hey! 
A:  i'm in college and i'm in a band. 
Q:  oh my god! that's wild! 
A:  yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter. 
Q:  well, it matters to me. 
A:  why? 
Q:  because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time. 
A:  you kissed her that night too? 
Q:  two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed. 
A:  seriously, where did this happen? 
Q:  okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right. she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips. i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back. it was only for a second, but... it was amazing. and now, now i find out that you kissed her first. 
A:  oh wait... what bed did you say she was on? 
Q:  mine. 
A:  i'm pretty sure i put her on my bed. 
Q:  no, she was definitely on my bed. 
A:  why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed? 
Q:  you were my first kiss ever? 
A:  what did i marry into? COMMERCIAL BREAK 
Q:  the wedding rehearsal dinner.] 
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  you look great. i'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them. 
Q:  okay, what did we say was your one gift to us? 
A:  no stupid jokes. i thought that was for the actual wedding. 
Q:  hey, i'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? but i'm just trying to be nice for the kids!  
A:   you know what i just realized? we have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow. 
Q:  uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet. 
A:  heh. 
Q:  oh, man! 
A:  this is like figure skating team all over again.  i mean synchronized swimming.  i mean- i mean the balance beam.  help me! 
Q:  football! 
A:  thank you. 
Q:  i can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding. 
A:  i know, i hate being left out of things. 
Q:  hey guys, how is it going? 
A:  fine. we're just sitting here. alone. doing nothing. it's our rehearsal for tomorrow. 
Q:  yeah look, about tomorrow, i... i've got a question for ya. i just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it. 
A:  what happened? 
Q:  i'll do it! 
A:   m-me-me-me! 
Q:  you both wanna do it? uhm... there's only room for one. 
A:  pick me, i look great in a tux and i will not steal focus. 
Q:   well, if phoebe's choosing, then say hello to mike's next groomsman. 
A:  oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me! 
Q:  please, you're going down! 
A:  you are going downer! 
Q:  is that what they say on the figure skating team? 
A:   i wouldn't know, i didn't make it!  
Q:  i decided to pee. 
A:  mike didn't tell you? you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen fell out. 
Q:  oh no, no. i can't choose between you two! i love you both so much! 
A:  just not enough to put us in the original wedding party. 
Q:  hi 
A:  hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy! 
Q:  even so, i think i'm gonna pick ross. 
A:  let me tell you why you need to pick me.  see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if i'm the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. 
Q:  all right fine, i pick you. 
A:   y-y-yeeesss! make "groom" for chandler. 
Q:  central perk. ross is getting coffee at the counter. chandler walks in.] 
A:  how's it going? 
Q:   good. i'm just getting some coffee. so i'm alert for the wedding. 
A:   that's what i was doing too. 
Q:   well, you have fun tonight. 
A:  you too. 
Q:  oh, i will. 
A:  me too.  
Q:  wait a minute, i know why i'm being such an ass, why are you? 
A:  i'm not supposed to tell you. 
Q:  i'm not supposed to tell you!  
A:  you told us both we could be in the wedding?  
Q:  rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. you and me together again.  
A:  rach, rach, knock knock. 
Q:  who's there? 
A:  i'll tell you at the wedding. 
Q:   you know, chappy's too small to handle all this snow. someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle. 
A:  so technically, would this person be in the wedding? 
Q:  no, but chandler, hello... aren't you scared of dogs? 
A:  i'm not scared.  i'll just take little chappy and...  he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed. 
Q:  okay, if joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle. 
A:   i'll do it. 
Q:  i'll... 
A:   na ha ha...  ne he he...  ah ah... 
Q:  okay.  it's zero hour. all teams execute on my count.  let's get this bad boy on the road. 
A:   is it okay that i want you to wear that head set in bed tonight? 
Q:   i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours. 
A:  oh yeah!  
Q:  groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  we've got a broken arrow. bridesmaid down!  oh, that's me.  
A:  ready? 
Q:   okay. 
A:  okay. 
Q:  oh wait, oh no. wait.  
A:  wow! aren't you gonna be cold? 
Q:  i don't care... i'll be my something blue. 
A:  you look beautiful. 
Q:  the hallway between the two apartments. chandler and joey are walking up the stairs.] 
A:  that really was an incredible wedding. 
Q:  it was, yeah. i kind of don't want it to end. hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage? 
A:  i'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and i'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had. 
Q:  nice. oh hey, what about ross? 
A:  i don't know. maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.  
Q:  oh! 
A:  so, where's mike? 
Q:  monica and chandler's apartment.] 
A:  hey. 
Q:  hey. 
A:  why are you wearing my apron? 
Q:  i'm making cookies for erica. and oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour. 
A:  oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if i introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  no? divorce? 
Q:  well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to new york so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, statue of liberty, empire state building... 
A:  oh, those places! there's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "mooooo"! 
Q:  honey. 
A:  i'm so sorry... 
Q:  everyone. erica, baby! 
A:  monica. calm, self. 
Q:  welcome to new york city! or should i say "ghe deu flooff new york city"? 
A:  why would you say that? 
Q:  oh yeah, let's do that! 
A:  great!  this baby'd better to be really good. 
Q:  oh, i'm glad. listen, i want to apologize about chandler, though. i just did not see this coming. 
A:   new york is awesome! 
Q:  what is with you? 
A:  yeah, i've been to these places before, but i've never really seen them, you know. 
Q:  well, if there is anything else you wanna know...  
A:  oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father? 
Q:  oh, sure. yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.  
A:  that's great. 
Q:  well, there is a chance it's another guy. i mean, i have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. 
A:  so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too? 
Q:  no... he killed his father with a shovel.  but other than that, he's a great guy. 
A:  i'll bet his dad doesn't think so.  
Q:  are you awake? 
A:  of course i'm awake. assume from now on that i'm always awake!  
Q:  alright, we don't know that it's him. i mean, it could be the football guy. 
A:  honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel-killer. 
Q:  alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? no! would we treat him any differently? 
A:  i'd keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is. 
Q:  how? 
A:  i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right? 
Q:  yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. 
A:  pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm! 
Q:  monica and chandler's apartment. monica and erica enter, chandler is in the kitchen.] 
A:  hey! how was lunch? 
Q:   we had a good time. by the way, i wanted to ask you something. it would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, jiminy billy bob  
A:   oh, really? 
Q:  no!  you we're right, that was fun! i'm gonna go finish packing. 
A:  o-okay.  so, is she gonna take the test? 
Q:  nope, she doesn't have to, i found out who the father is. 
A:  oh god. it's shovely-joe, isn't it? 
Q:   no it's not. 
A:  how do you know? 
Q:  well, it turns out that erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way. 
A:  oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do? 
Q:  the thing we never do. 
A:   shovely joe! 
Q:  oh! yeah, this is fun, couples night. 
A:  yeah, i don't know why we hang out with married couples more often. 
Q:  well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away. 
A:  you mean that portuguese couple? yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.  
Q:  oh, well, er, i already ate, but sure...!  guess what happened at work today... 
A:  a dinosaur died a million years ago? 
Q:  uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau... 
A:  you never did it! 
Q:  i'm sorry. it's just the idea of being an official bing. 
A:  hey! i will have you know that... aah, who am i kidding. let's call the kid geller and let bing die with me. 
Q:  all right, let's see, call me mrs hannigan. 
A:  mrs hannigan? 
Q:   hey guys. 
A:  hey joe! we've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. you want to come with us? 
Q:  all right. i know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house. 
A:  yeah, come with us. you'll see how close it is to the city. 
Q:  you know what? you are my friends, i wanna be supportive, i will come with you. shotgun! 
A:  damn it. 
Q:  wrong again! apparently you can change it to anything you want. so i thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. so meet princess consuela banana hammock. 
A:  that's what we were gonna name the baby. 
Q:  uhm, no. i'm gonna have my friends call me valerie.  
A:  hey, how'd the interview go? 
Q:  oh! it's not good. 
A:  you know, i always feel that way after an interview. i'll bet it went better than you think. 
Q:  well, i didn't get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren. 
A:  that is a bad interview. 
Q:  oh, i thought joey was here. five is good.  well, i'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow. 
A:  ooh! israeli champagne. and it's vanilla! 
Q:  ...that center around work. 
A:  to ross! 
Q:  thank you for letting us see the house again. 
A:  and thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... i've already forgotten what you said, but thank you. 
Q:  me too. yeah, this place is great. i'm so happy for you guys. although, you know, i hope you like fungus. 
A:  what? 
Q:   are you kiddin'? i think i just saw a bat in the corner! 
A:  when your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it? 
Q:  oh, i love this street. the trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences. 
A:  man, those two dogs are going at it! 
Q:   hey! 
A:  hey. 
Q:  oh, just er... you know, looking around. but you know what? this house... is great. 
A:  really? what changed your mind? 
Q:  oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing. 
A:  joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.  
Q:   what? 
A:  ha! i'm just messing with you. 
Q:  what? i get my own room? 
A:  you don't think we'd buy a house and not have a joey room do you? 
Q:  that guy mark. from bloomingdale's... she thinks he's just being nice to her. but i know he really wants to sleep with her. 
A:  it's seven years ago.  my time machine works! 
Q:  so what if he wants to sleep with her? i mean, she's single and he's cute. 
A:  excuse me? 
Q:  oh please! yesterday on the subway? you couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time. 
A:  for your information, i was staring at her baby. we're about to be parents. 
Q:  should we send something? 
A:  how did the job stuff go? 
Q:  he offered me one. 
A:  that's great! 
Q:  previously on friends... 
A:  how did the job stuff go? 
Q:  so if you take this job you'll be moving to paris? 
A:  or facing a bitch of a commute. 
Q:  i mean, i'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want. 
A:  my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.  
Q:  you okay with this? 
A:  well, it makes me feel sad, but... 
Q:  talking to ross. 
A:  i see. 
Q:  how is that gonna happen? 
A:  is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? 
Q:  hey phoebe. hey, tell me what you think. all right. the house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't. 
A:  we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright. 
Q:  but what if it is better than ours? should we at least look? 
A:  what do you think pheebs? 
Q:  well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard? 
A:  yeah. 
Q:  she died. 
A:  you're kidding! 
Q:  yeah, last saturday. wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one. 
A:  oh yeah? 
Q:  joey's gonna be *so* upset. 
A:  i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic. 
Q:  what if he reads it in the paper? 
A:  unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we're okay. 
Q:  thanks. 
A:  it feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do? 
Q:  what a small world! 
A:  and yet i never run into beyonce! 
Q:  oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie  
A:   don't, don't!  
Q:  no, actually, we're buying the house next door.  
A:   why!? 
Q:  ooh, that decides it then. i was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!  Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.  
A:  this can not be happening! 
Q:  okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will. 
A:  the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers. 
Q:   okay, okay,  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house. 
A:  that is a great idea! and by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!? 
Q:  okay, you come up with an idea. 
A:  alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out. 
Q:  but we love our house. 
A:  will we love it so much with her next door? and she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"! 
Q:  okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.  
A:   well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too.  
Q:  well... i just talked to sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it. 
A:  the hitlers will be so disappointed. 
Q:  all right, i got to run. tell monica i say goodbye. and... i'll see you later, neighbor.  
A:  wait! i just want you to know that... i'm so happy you're going to be here. 
Q:  oh, me too...  
A:  because... that way... we can pick up where we left off. 
Q:  huh? 
A:  i never stopped loving you. 
Q:  oh... my... 
A:  yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein. 
Q:  chandler, what are you talking about? 
A:  now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and Monica never have to know a thing. 
Q:  i don't know what to say... i mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us. 
A:   obviously. 
Q:  but i love my husband. and i know you love your wife. now, i don't think we should get this house now. 
A:  don't say that. don't tangle the dream and take it away. 
Q:  chandler, one of us has got to be strong. 
A:  i understand. 
Q:  although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...  Goodbye Chandler Bing.  
A:   they're never coming down now. 
Q:  damnit!  
A:  hey! 
Q:  hey! 
A:  so we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven. 
Q:  oh my god! i have nothing left to teach you!  
A:  where's your passport? 
Q:  it should be right next to my plane ticket. 
A:  well, it's not. 
Q:  are, are you kidding? this is packing? 
A:  we're taking a break! 
Q:  from? 
A:  jumping on the bed? 
Q:  you got it! . all right, she's right, we gotta get serious.  let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him! 
A:  no, no, no, guys. she's right. we should get to work. i'll take stuff out of the closet, joey you pack 'em and ross you re-pack whatever joey packs.  
Q:  you guys hear a ringing? 
A:   what the hell is this? 
Q:  chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out. 
A:  i didn't know monica had these! 
Q:  mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. maybe richard! 
A:  why would she use them with richard and not me? i can be kinky! i once did a naked dance for her... with scarves! 
Q:   hey. 
A:  hey. 
Q:  oh, man! i can't believe she's actually leaving. how am i gonna say goodbye to rachel? 
A:  i know, she's been such a big part of my life. and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled.  i mean... oh, forget it. i miss melrose place! 
Q:  who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? head she wins, tails i lose.  wait a minute... 
A:  yes, joe? 
Q:  chandler? i was just in our bedroom and i found these  on my pillow. 
A:  oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play! 
Q:  what are you talking about? these aren't mine. 
A:  oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from me! 
Q:  that would be a terrible punishment. but, i'm serious, i've never seen these before. 
A:  really? then what are they doing in our guestroom? 
Q:  rachel used to live in that room. 
A:  rachel... with handcuffs! interesting!  
Q:  joey's bare ass! 
A:  . well played.  
Q:   oh no, she took down monica... and i'm the crier in the family. oh god! i could be next. maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. oh, so that thing you said about the thing. it really made me think about that other thing. 
A:  uh, rach? 
Q:  i really made you think about that thing uh? 
A:   uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you.  
Q:   oh, i'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don't get. 
A:  no, no, no... they're really yours. we... found them in your old room. 
Q:  well, these aren't mine. maybe monica used to use them with... 
A:  don't say richard! well, if they're not monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they? 
Q:  well, i think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room. 
A:  pheebs! 
Q:   yeah! 
A:  i think these are yours. 
Q:   can i talk to you alone for a minute? 
A:  sure.  you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you? 
Q:  oh honey... 
A:  let me just say something... because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you. and i'm so sad that you're leaving. 
Q:   oh, you know what? let's not say anything else. i love you.  
A:  ooh, not so tight...  i'm sorry, just give me one more chance. 
Q:  oh! 
A:  i'm sor... just go. just go. i can't, i can't. 
Q:  i don't think so. 
A:  oh, you're definately not. i haven't cried like that in years. 
Q:  you cried yesterday at the six o'clock news. 
A:  that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. 
Q:  yeah. mine too. 
A:  mine was a humdinger 
Q:  tell me about it. 
A:  well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party. 
Q:  we're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. it would be great if you guys could pitch in. 
A:  joey and i can finish up in the guest room. 
Q:  oh no! you and phoebe are gonna help me in here. 
A:   you couldn't be cool.  
Q:  good! now i need you to be careful and efficient. and remember, if i am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong. 
A:  hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are. 
Q:  you did? how? 
A:  well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used. 
Q:  who's that dirty old lady? 
A:  monica's grandmother. 
Q:  oh my god! 
A:  relax! we just get her some antacids. 
Q:  she doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor. 
A:  oh my god! 
Q:  all right, chandler get the coats. erica let's go. phoebe and joey, keep packing! oh my god we're gonna have a baby. all right. we're gonna have a baby! oh my god, we're gonna have a baby! oh god, oh god, i got to sit down, i got to sit down. ooh!  
A:  honey, it's gonna be okay. 
Q:  chandler, wait, wait, wait... 
A:  what? 
Q:  oh my god! 
A:  relax! we'll just get her some antacids. 
Q:  she doesn't have a stomach-ache. she's in labor! 
A:  oh my god!  
Q:  breathe, breathe, breathe... good. 
A:  next time, can i say breathe? 
Q:  alright, i'll be right back. 
A:  where are you going? 
Q:  to use the bathroom. 
A:  you can't leave me alone with her. 
Q:  what? 
A:  this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with! 
Q:  what kind of social situation are you comfortable with? 
A:  it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together. 
Q:  you'll be fine. nah, you won't, but i'll be back in two minutes. 
A:  okay.  
Q:  i don't know. maybe church-camp? 
A:  hah. may not wanna mention this. so, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts? 
Q:  what? 
A:  well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  
Q:  help me! this hurts! 
A:  is it really that bad? 
Q:  oh! oh my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!  
A:  i'm okay. 
Q:  chandler, you don't wanna miss this. this is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life! 
A:  alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle. 
Q:  it's a... it's a boy! 
A:  wow! 
Q:  oh, you did it! 
A:   it's a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see. 
Q:  would you like to cut the umbilical cord?  
A:  well, that's spongy. 
Q:   oh, hey handsome! oh, i'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  Oh, we are so lucky! 
A:  i know. he has your eyes.  
Q:  we'll just get him cleaned up a bit.  
A:  okay. 
Q:  i'm really happy for you guys. 
A:  how do you feel? 
Q:  you know it's twins, right? 
A:  oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know! COMMERCIAL BREAK 
Q:  i can't believe you didn't know it's twins! this has never happened before. 
A:  well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good. 
Q:  twins actually run in my family. 
A:  interesting!  can i see you for a second?  
Q:  what do you mean "what do we do"? 
A:   twins! twins!! 
Q:  chandler, you're panicking! 
A:  uh-huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one? 
Q:  we can't split them up! 
A:  why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody. 
Q:  okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible? 
A:  what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king? 
Q:  yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt. 
A:  monica, we are not ready to have two babies! 
Q:  that doesn't matter! we have waited so long for this. i don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children! 
A:   okay. shhh...  
Q:  okay! 
A:  okay! 
Q:  here she comes! 
A:   she? it's a girl? 
Q:  yeah. 
A:   well, now we have one of each!  And that's enough! 
Q:  do you think they recognize each other from in there? 
A:  maybe. unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet. 
Q:  bye! 
A:  bye! 
Q:  okay. 
A:  have fun at church-camp!  
Q:  oh, look at these little bunnies! 
A:  i know! you ready to trade? 
Q:  okay. 
A:  okay. 
Q:  alright, let's see..  
A:  we could trade later. 
Q:  hi! oh my gosh!  
A:  hey.  
Q:   this is a boy,  and that's a girl. 
A:  her name is erica. 
Q:  hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica. 
A:  yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together. 
Q:  i love you. 
A:  i love you. 
Q:  this is so cool! 
A:  i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited! 
Q:  quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...  
A:  we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this. 
Q:  okay, i wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!  
A:  really? you got us a chick and a duck? 
Q:  yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone! 
A:  oh, don't worry, we'll find them. 
Q:  actually, i'm gonna go check on the twins. 
A:  alright.  
Q:  oh! 
A:  it's okay, it's just an egg roll. 
Q:  just put it on a plate and leave.  
A:  okay, let's find these birds. 
Q:  oh! they're in the table! 
A:  well, that can't be good! 
Q:  we gotta get them out of there! 
A:  how? 
Q:  oh, oh! maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls? 
A:  oh, tons, i'm quite the woodsman. 
Q:  well, maybe we can just tip the table a little. 
A:  joey, wait! the ball! 
Q:  oh god! so what do we do? 
A:  i don't know. maybe we can open this up somehow. 
Q:  okay. 
A:  no... it's all glued together. 
Q:  does that mean we have to bust it open? 
A:  i don't know. maybe. 
Q:  oh my god! 
A:  i know! it's.. it's the foosball table. 
Q:  all right, you know what? we don't have a choice. it's like i would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine." 
A:  did that movie ever get made? 
Q:   don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there. 
A:  and we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.  
Q:  okay. here goes. 
A:  what's the matter? 
Q:  i need to say goodbye to the table first. 
A:  i understand. 
Q:  okay. table, you have given us so many great times. and you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything? 
A:  i don't know. except that, for one last time...  Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game. 
Q:  okay, here we go. i can't do it. 
A:  well, i can't do it either.  
Q:  yeah, they're stuck inside the table! 
A:  we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it! 
Q:  alright. my job here is done. 
A:  that was... impressive. 
Q:  yeah, they were just slowing me down. alright, i have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.  
A:  sorry about the table, man. 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  you gonna buy a new one? 
Q:  probably not. nah. i don't know how much i'm gonna wanna play after you go. 
A:  well, at least we got these little guys out. 
Q:  yeah. 
A:  aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh? 
Q:  i'm gonna miss these little guys. it was nice having birds around again. 
A:  hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you. 
Q:  what? 
A:  yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus, here they'd have their own room. 
Q:  i could get a goose! 
A:  you know, i - i think you're set with the poultry. 
Q:  thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit. 
A:  i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake? 
Q:  well, that's it. everything's packed. 
A:  wow, this is weird. 
Q:  yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway. 
A:  where's ross? 
Q:  has it always been purple? 
A:   look around, you guys. this was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!  
Q:  oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our keys. 
A:  oh, okay.  
Q:   this is harder than i thought it would be. 
A:  oh, it's gonna be okay.  
Q:  okay, should we get some coffee? 
A:  sure. where?  THE END
